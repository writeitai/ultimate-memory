# RS-LoCoMo-Full-v1 setup

This directory contains the unshipped full-system LoCoMo adapter. It does not vendor or
auto-download LoCoMo. Supply the exact pinned `locomo10.json` only after confirming its
CC BY-NC 4.0 terms.

Install the repository plus deterministic scorer dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra benchmark
```

The safe first command is local and makes no API or model call:

```bash
uv run --extra benchmark python -m benchmarks.locomo prepare \
  --dataset /absolute/path/locomo10.json \
  --tier smoke \
  --output .benchmark-runs/locomo-smoke
```

The harness validates the pinned bytes, renders session documents, and fingerprints the
eight-question smoke plan. Do not run remote stages until reviewing
[`locomo_benchmark_design.md`](../../plan/designs/locomo_benchmark_design.md).

The stock Compose deployment now includes all ten continuous E/P1 workers. After ingesting one
isolated conversation and waiting for them to settle, publish the aggregate projections once:

```bash
docker compose --profile operations run --rm projections
```

The `answer` command then calls the public readiness endpoint. It refuses to run unless every
requested version completed the exact composed stage generations and both P2/P3 builds began
after that work completed. It also refuses a changed public recipe catalog. There is no manual “index ready”
acknowledgement.

Readiness also records the API process's current non-secret model configuration for operator
review. Those values are not processing-time provenance; freeze one Compose environment for the
run and retain the provider/cost artifacts.

The primary protocol uses a bounded answer agent over normal public recipes, not hard-coded claim
search. Limits are run-absolute: allow up to nine agent calls per selected question and one judge
call per answer. The shared evaluator-cost value is a reported-spend stop threshold: a completed
call can cross it, is recorded, and stops the run. Use the provider account cap as the hard
monetary boundary. If that leaves later questions unanswered, they remain visible as zero-scored
missing records; resuming them requires an explicitly higher threshold.

P3 is built and freshness-checked as part of the ordinary deployment, but the remote recipe
agent has no filesystem mount. This protocol therefore does not attribute answer quality to P3
navigation. A future mount-enabled protocol needs a new fingerprint and name.

No real benchmark has been run as part of the setup implementation.
