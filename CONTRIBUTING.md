# Contributing to RememberStack

Thank you for helping improve RememberStack. Keep changes focused: for substantial work,
open an issue first so the scope and design boundary are clear before implementation.

## Development

The repository uses `uv` and supports Python 3.12 through 3.14.

```bash
uv sync --locked --python 3.14
uv run ruff check src/
uv run ruff format --check src/
uv run pyright src/ --pythonversion 3.14
uv run pytest src/tests -q
```

Run the smallest relevant test set while iterating, then the complete checks appropriate
to the change before requesting review. User-facing behavior changes must update the
corresponding documentation in the same pull request.

## Contributor agreement

RememberStack is currently distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. Before a
human-authored pull request can merge, its author must accept the
[RememberStack Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md).

The agreement is a license, not a copyright assignment: You keep ownership of Your
Contribution. It gives WriteIt.ai s.r.o. the rights needed to maintain and distribute
RememberStack, including a bounded ability to change the outbound license. Any such
license must continue to make source available and permit free self-hosting as defined
in the agreement.

The pull-request template contains the required assent checkbox. The `CLA` job fails
until the exact box is checked, and that status is required in `main` protection, so a
failure blocks merge. A later agreement version requires fresh assent and does not
retroactively expand an earlier grant.

If Your employer or another entity owns the work, only accept on its behalf if You are
authorized to bind it, and identify that entity in the pull-request field. The assent
covers only work that the accepting individual or entity owns or is authorized to
license. Split contributions into separate pull requests when copyrightable work from
another author is not covered by that authority. Identify third-party material and its
license in the pull request; do not represent third-party work as Your Contribution.

## Pull requests

- Keep each pull request limited to one coherent change.
- Explain the behavior change and the verification performed.
- Preserve unrelated user changes and generated artifacts.
- Do not include secrets, private data, or material You cannot license.
- Expect maintainers to request changes that reduce complexity or scope.

Project names and logos are governed separately by the
