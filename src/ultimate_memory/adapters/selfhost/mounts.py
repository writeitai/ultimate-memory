"""Local-directory mount publisher: the four D51 read-only views (e0 §5).

Agents read the memory on their filesystem: the **corpus filesystem** they
browse first, the **artifacts** they drill into from a stub, the **raw**
originals — deliberately *off the navigation path* — and the Plane-K
checkout. Every view is read-only; writes always go through the pipeline
and Postgres stays the authority.

The self-host tier materializes what the cloud tier gets from a bucket
mount, and implements D51's three guardrails here rather than assuming
them of infrastructure:

1. **Raw is off-path.** Nothing in the corpus tree links into it; reaching
   an original means following an explicit `raw_uri` from a stub or from
   `document.md` frontmatter — a deliberate act, never a browse default.
2. **Data-access audit logging is mandatory.** The audit property came
   from logging, not from keeping raw unmounted (a mount read is still a
   read), so originals are readable only through `AuditedRawReader`, which
   refuses an unattributed request rather than logging a blank.
3. **Storage class routes by mime.** Media a multimodal harness actually
   reads stays hot; text/office originals kept only for audit and
   re-conversion go cold — this kills the grep-the-archive cost bug at the
   source. Per-deployment config, like the D38 converter router.

The corpus view always serves the snapshot the registry marks latest, and
swaps whole trees atomically, so a browsing agent never walks a half-built
tree.
