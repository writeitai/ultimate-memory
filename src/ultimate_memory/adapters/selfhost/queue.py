"""The self-host delivery shell: LISTEN/NOTIFY wake-ups + SKIP LOCKED claiming (D62/D67).

Work is Postgres rows; this shell only delivers wake-ups. The schema-owned
insert trigger provides the transactional initial wake; `announce` re-announces
existing rows through the spine's notification primitive; the worker loop
sleeps on LISTEN with a slow fallback poll and claims only its configured
route, consulting a token bucket around each claim.
