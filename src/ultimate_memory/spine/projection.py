"""The P2 projection catalog (D7/D44): snapshot registry + the export reads.

Spine-owned SQL for the rebuild-first graph pipeline (p2 §5). The
`projection_snapshots` registry is the pointer readers follow (`is_latest`,
one per deployment/plane — the object store holds only immutable snapshot
bytes, never a mutable pointer). The export executes the spike battery's
bound strategy: the survivor map materializes ONCE into an indexed temp
table per export connection, and every edge read joins against it — the
`v_graph_*` views remain the semantic contract, the catalog owns the
execution shape (`plan/analysis/p2_spike_battery.md`, finding 2).
