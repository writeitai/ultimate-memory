"""T0 entity resolution over the alias registry (D17): exact match or mint.

T0 is the cheapest cascade tier: an exact match on the normalized
`llm_canonical` lemma. A miss mints a new canonical entity (the novelty path)
with its alias, and every resolution — hit or mint — writes the immutable
mention and an append-only resolution verdict. Higher tiers (T1-T4 blocking
and adjudication) arrive with the truth-machinery phase.
