"""The deterministic E1 chunker: anchor-stabilized packing of whole blocks (D58).

A chunk is an ordered run of whole blocks within one section, packed to a
token budget. Boundaries are stabilized by content anchors: a block whose hash
satisfies the anchor predicate forces a boundary before it, so an early edit
perturbs packing only up to the next anchor instead of rippling through the
document (e1 §4). Chunks never overlap and never split a block; an oversized
block becomes its own oversized chunk rather than being cut.

chunks = f(blocks, sections, budget, anchors, CHUNKER_VERSION): a parameter
change is a version bump and a cheap repack of existing atoms.
