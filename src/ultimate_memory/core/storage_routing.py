"""Storage-class routing for raw originals (D51 guardrail 3).

Which originals stay cheap to read and which go cold is a *policy* decision
about the corpus, not a storage-provider mechanic — so it lives here, in
pure logic, and both the ingest path (which routes at the write) and the
provider adapters (which apply the class) depend on it rather than on each
other.

Media a multimodal harness actually reads stays hot: for a video, an audio
file, or a photo *input*, the original IS the artifact — conversion yields
only a lossy transcript or description. Text and office originals are kept
for audit and re-conversion, so they go cold. Routing at the write is what
kills the grep-the-archive cost bug at the source rather than on the bill.
