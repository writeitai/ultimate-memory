"""The `graph` primitive (retrieval §3, p2 §4/§6): traversal over the snapshot.

Three typed, zero-LLM operations over the published P2 snapshot:

- **neighborhood(entity, hops, predicates?)** — everything within N hops,
  distance-ranked, with an EXPLICIT truncation marker whenever a hub
  exceeds the page cap (S18: never a silent top-k).
- **path(a, b, max_hops)** — how two entities connect, shortest-first. A
  path is a COMPOUND result: it revalidates as a unit, so a dropped edge
  drops the whole path rather than silently yielding a shorter, false
  connection (S17/S21).
- **citation_path(from_doc, to_doc, max_hops)** — the document graph
  (`DOC_CROSSREF`), for "which documents ultimately cite X" (S22).

Both entity operations accept the temporal parameters and echo what they
applied. As-of traversal uses the engine's **inline recursive-pattern
predicate** — evaluated per edge DURING the neighbor scan, verified live in
the WP-4.1 spike battery — never the post-hoc `all(r IN rels(p) …)` form.
Projected graphs are not an option: they feed the algorithm extensions only
and cannot be `MATCH`-traversed (D44).

Three engine constraints shape every query here (recorded with canaries in
`plan/analysis/p2_spike_battery.md`): recursive bounds cap at 30 hops; NULL
parameters cannot participate in typed comparisons, so temporal conjuncts
are composed conditionally; and a plain variable-length match enumerates
paths combinatorially, so `SHORTEST` is load-bearing for reachability.
