"""Machine-verifiable readiness for the ordinary self-host pipeline.

The work ledger remains authoritative. This read model checks the exact
component generations composed by a profile for each requested document
version, then verifies that P2 and P3 builds began after those terminal
E-stage rows. Publication time alone is insufficient: an older build can
finish after newer document work. This read does not execute work or hide
failures.
