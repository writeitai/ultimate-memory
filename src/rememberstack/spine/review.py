"""The review queue (D24, registries §8, lifecycle §4): reversible verdicts.

Clusters, not pairs; only the expected-impact middle band reaches humans;
every action appends a reversible, provenance-stamped record — a merge
verdict lands in `merge_events` (decided_by=human), a support_withdrawn
verdict lands as a currency event (restore) or an invalidation with its
adjudication (invalidate). `uncertain` is the only non-terminal outcome and
deliberately leaves the marker standing.
