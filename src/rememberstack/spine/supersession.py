"""The relation supersession cascade (D3/D4): blocking → novelty → ladder.

Adjudication operates on RELATIONS, never claims (D3): "Alice left Acme"
closes the validity window of `(alice, works_for, acme)` — one row update —
while every claim stays an immutable record of what sources asserted.
Candidates are found by `(subject, predicate)` blocking over the small
distinct-fact table, only for change-prone predicates; a novelty gate routes
clear ADDs past the LLM entirely; the ambiguous residue climbs the
small→frontier ladder. Every decision lands append-only in
`relation_adjudications` — the S8 "why do we believe…" audit surface — and
the adjudicator fails safe to coexist when unsure.

Decide:
- supersede: the world changed — the NEW fact replaces the EXISTING one
