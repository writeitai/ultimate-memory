"""Extension-pack installation (registries §4/§7, D15): enable a pack as a unit.

Installing writes the pack's registry rows for one deployment — entity types,
predicates, and domain/range signatures, all `tier='extension'` with the pack
id — after verifying every anchor exists (extend-never-fork: an extension
type MUST declare a registered parent; a pack that forks is refused whole).
Idempotent: enabling twice is a no-op.
