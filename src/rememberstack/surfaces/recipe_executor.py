"""The recipe executor (D50): replay a registry chain over the primitives.

A recipe is *exactly* its chain — it adds no capability an agent could not
compose from the §3 primitives itself. This executor is where that becomes
literally true: it walks the chain, calls each named primitive on the
`QueryEngine` with the recipe's frozen settings and the caller's bound
arguments, threads earlier steps' rankings into `fuse`, and returns the last
step's envelope. Because the executor calls the same public methods an agent
would, "recipe ≡ hand-composed chain" is a property the eval harness proves by
running both and diffing (retrieval §4).

The executor implements a handler per op in use; the linter (`core`) has
already rejected any chain that names an unknown op or misreports its grain,
so a chain that reaches the executor is well-formed.
