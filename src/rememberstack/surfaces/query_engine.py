"""The zero-LLM query engine (retrieval §2-§3): resolve, lookup, search, hydrate.

The one correctness rule is D48: projections (P1 Lance) may NOMINATE
candidates, but every returned record has passed by-ID hydration against the
live Postgres spine — a superseded fact can never be served as current, and
nominations hydration rejects are counted in `dropped_by_hydration` so ranked
results are honest about their denominator. No primitive calls an LLM; reads
never trigger anything.
