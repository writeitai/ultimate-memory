"""The recipe registration linter (D50/D41): grain semantics, mechanically.

A recipe declares two enums — `output_grain` and `answer_intent` — and a
`chain` of primitive ops. The database CHECK enforces the headline bar
(`current_facts` ⇒ `fact` grain); this linter enforces the *chain-level*
rules the DB cannot see, so a registration that would let a recipe lie about
what it returns is rejected before it ever reaches a surface:

- **`current_facts` may ride only validity-filtered fact primitives.** This
  is the D41 bar in full: a recipe that answers "what holds now" must compose
  lookups/aggregates that filter both temporal clocks — never a claims search,
  which is evidence ("what a source *asserted*"), not fact.
- **The chain's terminal grain must match `output_grain`.** A recipe that
  ends on a claims search cannot advertise `fact`; one that ends on a K-page
  read cannot advertise `evidence`. The grain a caller reads is the grain the
  last step actually produces.
- **Each intent implies a shape.** `assertion_history` is evidence-grain,
  `change_feed` ends on the delta, `audit` ends on a decision trail. These
  keep the MCP tool a caller sees honest about what it will get back.

`fuse` produces an **evidence-grade ordering**, not the confirmed records
themselves: its output is a ranking of candidate ids still to be hydrated
(matching the `fuse` primitive's own grain), so a recipe that ends on a fuse
is evidence, never fact. The op vocabulary the linter accepts is exactly the
set the executor can run — a chain never lints only to fail at execution.
