"""Pure rank operators (retrieval §3: `fuse`, `rerank`): the D9 fusion math.

These are the fusion and reranking stages as *pure* functions — no spine, no
ports, no I/O — so the same code fuses an agent's ad-hoc channel set and a
recipe's fixed one, and every stage is inspectable rather than a black box.

**Reciprocal-rank fusion (RRF).** When several channels each return a ranked
list — semantic search, BM25, FTS — they cannot be compared by raw score:
a cosine distance and a BM25 score are different units, and two embedding
families are not on the same scale either. RRF sidesteps that by scoring an
item purely on its *ranks*: an item that placed 1st in one channel and 3rd in
another scores ``1/(k+1) + 1/(k+3)``. The constant ``k`` (≈60, a starting
default retained after the WP-5.6 relevance grid could not distinguish the
tested values) damps the top ranks so one channel cannot dominate on a single
high placement. Items no channel returned score zero and drop out. The result
is one order that rewards agreement across channels without ever comparing
incomparable scores.

**Reranking** is the same currency read differently: given a set of items each
carrying a named signal (graph distance to a focal entity, evidence count),
reorder by that signal. It is a stage, not a verdict — the caller sees the
signal value on every item and can chain another stage on top.
