"""Reconciliation, finalization, and deletion grains (lifecycle §3–5, §8).

One flow for both lifecycle problems: when a version's chain completes, the
reconcile stage diffs the lineage's testimony, transitions currency, recounts
the touched facts, applies the §4 zero-support policy, and emits the
fact-level `evidence_changed` delta. The policy's two branches never mix:

- **the source acted** (a living edit removed content, a deletion) → close
  per shape, recorded and reversible, no flag;
- **only our transcription changed** (an extractor bump did not re-derive a
  claim from the unchanged file) → flag `support_withdrawn` for review; this
  is the flag's only trigger.

Watched lineages defer source-acted closure to their sync cycle's
FINALIZATION (the retract-timing barrier): an intra-cycle move resolves as a
support swap, never retract-then-reassert. The `CycleFinalizer` runs that
job; `DeletionService` is the operator's grain (§8) through the same
cascade.
