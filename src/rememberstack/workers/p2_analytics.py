"""Graph analytics on the freshly built snapshot (p2 §7, D11 → D72).

PageRank (salience prior), k-core (hub-ness), weakly-connected components
(ER-health signal), and **Louvain community detection** all run natively in
the engine on the snapshot the rebuild just validated — Louvain included,
which D72 corrected after verifying it live on the deployed build (the
vendored survey behind D11 said it was absent, so the original plan carried
an external igraph pass; the simpler mechanism removes it).

Results are written **back to Postgres** and never reprojected into the
graph's node tables: analytics are graph-DERIVED, so loading them into the
projection would be circular (D6). Community *labels* — the K1 navigation
aid — are an optional batched micro-LLM call over each community's top
members by PageRank; without a provider the communities are unlabeled,
which costs navigation polish and nothing load-bearing.
