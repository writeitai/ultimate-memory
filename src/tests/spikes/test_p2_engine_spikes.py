"""WP-4.1: the D44 spike battery against the DEPLOYED LadybugDB engine.

Question #20a's six spikes, executable. Each runs CI-sized for correctness;
the perf-shaped ones scale with ``REMEMBERSTACK_SPIKE_SCALE`` (rows) for the recorded
local measurements in `plan/analysis/p2_spike_battery.md`. The battery
doubles as a capability canary: every verdict is asserted in a way that
FLIPS if a future engine version changes the behavior (the enum-only
ATTACH reproduction, the 30-hop cap, the discriminating as-of counts) —
never a comment that goes stale silently.
