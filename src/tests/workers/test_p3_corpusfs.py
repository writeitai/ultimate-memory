"""WP-4.5 acceptance: the P3 corpus filesystem (e0 §6, D40).

The tree rebuilds whole, publishes as an immutable snapshot, and satisfies
the two contracts that make it worth having: **Tier-1 paths never move
across rebuilds** (S44's durable targets), and **one `_index.md` read tells
an agent what every file in the directory is about** — navigation cheaper
than search, with zero LLM inside the builder.
