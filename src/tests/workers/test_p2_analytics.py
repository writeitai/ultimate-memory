"""WP-4.4 acceptance: native graph analytics + writeback (p2 §7, D72).

Louvain, PageRank, k-core, and WCC run on the freshly built snapshot and
land in Postgres: communities with sizes and labels, per-entity metrics
with community membership, and the published snapshot's degrees copied
into the registry's blast-radius cache. The graph stays a projection —
nothing computed here is ever loaded back into its node tables.
