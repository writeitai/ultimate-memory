"""WP-4.3 acceptance: the `graph` primitive against S17–S22.

Each scenario class runs over a real rebuilt snapshot: S17 (how are A and
B connected), S18 (2-hop neighborhood with EXPLICIT truncation), S19
(predicate-constrained multi-hop), S20 (graph join across predicates), S21
(multi-hop as-of via inline path predicates), S22 (document-graph
transitive citation). The negatives are typed, and the caps are never
silent.
