"""WP-5.3 acceptance: the complete envelope contract (retrieval §5-§6, D49).

The envelope is the answer's machine-readable self-account, and several of its
rules are contract, not garnish — proved here over a seeded corpus:

- **Contradiction co-members are never silently absent (S23).** A fact in a
  live contradiction group ALWAYS carries the other sides (bounded by a cap,
  with group_id/returned/total/continuation) — even when the query returns
  just one side.
- **A withdrawn fact is flagged, not vanished (D54).** An open
  `support_withdrawn` review marks the fact `support=withdrawn`; it is still
  returned.
- **Composite answers are explicitly two-part, never blended (S47).** `parts`
  belong only to a composite envelope, and each part is strictly single-grain.
- **Identity regime and believed_at horizons are stated (S61, §3).** Reads
  echo which identity boundary answered; a query before a finite channel
  horizon is a typed `boundary`, never a silent truncation.
- **The negative taxonomy is frozen (S29/S39/S55).** Exactly three kinds, no
  `denied`.
