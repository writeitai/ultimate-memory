# Architecture Decision Log

Decisions made during requirements/design exploration (June 2026), with context and rationale.
Companion docs: `plan/requirements/requirements_v3.md` (what),
`plan/designs/p2_graph_design.md` (graph how), `plan/analysis/concepts.md` (data-model
explainer), `plan/analysis/ladybug_capabilities.md` (verified DB facts), `questions.md`
(open). Naming note: D1–D13 predate the E/K/P plane naming (D14) and keep their original
L-numbers as historical record.

---

## D1. Split source of truth: Postgres vs. the git repo

**Decision.** Postgres is authoritative for L0–L2 and L6 — everything deterministically
derivable. The L3–L5 git repo is *itself* a source of truth (backed up independently);
Postgres holds only its provenance and triggers.

**Context.** v1 required "the entire system rebuildable from Postgres" while also making
L3–L5 LLM-derived git-tracked layers. LLM output is non-deterministic — those layers are not
reproducible from Postgres unless model+prompt+inputs are pinned, and even then re-runs differ.
The two requirements contradicted each other.

**Consequences.** Rebuild guarantees apply to L0–L2+L6 only. The repo needs its own backup
discipline. Postgres records prompt/model/embedding versions per derived artifact so partial
reproducibility is still auditable.

**Refined by D46.** "Not reproducible" was over-scoped: LLM non-determinism blocks *byte*
reproducibility, not *semantic* reproducibility. Compiled K pages are semantically regenerable
from the spine plus their recorded compile inputs; the git repo's **irreducible** source-of-truth
core — what backups genuinely protect — is human-authored content (authored pages + curation
sidecars).

---

## D2. Claims and relations are distinct concepts (many-to-many)

**Decision.** L2 claims are atomic *natural-language assertions* (identity =
assertion-by-a-source; immutable, append-only). A separate normalization step maps eligible
claims onto **relation** records `(subject_entity, predicate, object_entity)` (identity = the
fact itself). Join table `relation_evidence(relation_id, claim_id, stance)` connects them.

**Context.** An earlier draft stamped `claim_id` directly on graph edges, silently assuming
claims ≅ triplets 1:1. They aren't: one claim can yield several facts; one fact can be asserted
by hundreds of documents; many claims (opinions, n-ary, single-entity attributes) yield none.

**Consequences.**
- Corpus redundancy collapses: N documents asserting the same fact = one relation with N
  evidence rows, not N parallel edges. `evidence_count` becomes a free confidence/salience
  signal (and a candidate filter for L5 core beliefs).
- Graph edge count scales with distinct facts, not corpus size.
- Full reasoning in `plan/analysis/concepts.md`.

**Refined by D54.** The evidence *rows* stay claim-grained (provenance, unchanged), but the
cached **count's denominator** is corrected: `evidence_count` ≡ distinct document *lineages*
with *current-testimony* support — not claim rows, which inflate under re-extraction, document
versioning, and within-document repetition. Rationale: `evidence_lifecycle_design.md` §4.

---

## D3. Supersession/contradiction adjudication operates at the relation level

**Decision.** "Alice left Acme" closes the validity window of the relation
`(alice, works_at, acme)` — one row update. Claims are never marked superseded; they remain
true as records of what sources asserted.

**Context.** Claim-level supersession would require finding and flagging every assertion that
ever implied the old fact (hundreds of records, inevitable misses → zombie facts in
retrieval). Mirrors how Graphiti invalidates edges, not episodes.

**Consequences.** Two clocks with different semantics: claim timestamps (asserted/ingested)
never change; relation windows (valid_from/valid_until + ingested_at/invalidated_at) are
revisable adjudications over evidence. Both time-travel questions ("was it true at T?" /
"what did we believe at T?") stay answerable.

**Refined by D41.** Claims additionally carry an *immutable* source-asserted validity interval
(testimony about temporal extent). It never becomes revisable and never introduces claim-level
supersession — the adjudicated window stays relation-only; this strengthens, not weakens, D3.

---

## D4. Supersession detection via entity-keyed blocking + cheap-first cascade

**Decision.** Candidate conflicts are found by blocking on `(entity_id, predicate)` over the
relations table (small — distinct facts only), then escalating: exact → fuzzy → embedding
similarity → small model → frontier LLM only for the residue. A novelty gate (similarity
thresholds) routes clear ADD/NOOP cases past the LLM entirely.

**Context.** O(N) vector-similarity scans per write are both unaffordable at millions of
claims and imprecise (they surface compatible-but-related statements, forcing wasted LLM
judgments). Convergent recommendation of both external reviews. Blocking requires a predicate
— which raw NL claims don't have — making the relations table (D2) the enabling index.

**Consequences.** Write-side LLM cost scales with ambiguity, not volume. Entity-resolution
quality becomes make-or-break (false negatives in resolution = missed supersessions) →
invest in the registry early. Coreference is a *guarantee* (no claim leaves E2 with a dangling
pronoun), not necessarily a discrete prior stage — its topology is set by D19. Tier thresholds
mentioned here are placeholders superseded by D17 (per-type, golden-set-tuned).

---

## D5. Predicate vocabulary is governed, not emergent

**Decision.** A Postgres predicate registry (name, description, synonyms, status). Extraction
is constrained to the registry with an `other:<freetext>` escape; a periodic job reviews and
promotes/maps frequent `other:` values. Start strict (high precision, smaller graph).

**Context.** Free-text predicates fragment ("works_at"/"employed_by"/"is employee of"),
silently breaking both `(entity_id, predicate)` blocking and graph queries.

**Consequences.** Ontology evolves by review, not accretion. Because the graph rebuilds (D7),
vocabulary cleanups apply retroactively for free. Loosening later is cheap; tightening a noisy
vocabulary later is not — hence strict-first.

---

## D6. The graph (L6) is a derived projection, never an authority

**Decision.** LadybugDB holds a read-optimized projection of Postgres facts. It makes no
decisions, stores no unique state, holds **no embeddings**, and can be deleted and rebuilt at
any time. Validity metadata has exactly one home: Postgres.

**Context.** The strongest finding from the external supersession review: replicated
invalidation state across vector/graph stores drifts (documented Mem0 desync bug class).
Deliberate divergence from Graphiti, which adjudicates inside the graph at write time — we
already paid for adjudication at L2; a second authority would only create disagreement.

**Consequences.** The graph writer is dumb and deterministic. Graph corruption is a
non-event (rebuild). All cross-store consistency questions reduce to "how stale is the
projection," bounded by rebuild cadence.

**Refined by D41.** Claim-grain asserted-validity is *evidence*, not a second validity home: it is
immutable and many-valued, lives in Postgres only, and the `claims_as_of` recipe is barred from
answering current-fact — so validity-as-current-fact still has exactly one home.

---

## D7. Rebuild-first sync; immutable GCS snapshots; read-only readers

**Decision.** The L6 worker periodically rebuilds the entire graph from a Postgres → Parquet
export (`COPY FROM` bulk load), validates, and publishes an immutable versioned snapshot to
GCS (write-then-pointer-swap). Readers download the `latest` snapshot, open READ_ONLY, and
hot-swap on updates. Incremental event application is a **deliberate non-goal** — rebuild-first
is the design; incremental is a documented alternative (`p2_graph_design.md` §5) we would adopt
only if sub-hour graph freshness ever became a hard requirement.

**Context.** LadybugDB's verified concurrency model is one READ_WRITE process XOR many
READ_ONLY processes — snapshot serving is the intended usage, not a workaround. Sizing at the
1M-doc target (distinct relations, few GB, minutes to bulk-load) makes full rebuilds cheap.

**Consequences.**
- Drift between Postgres and graph is impossible beyond one cycle — no reconciliation jobs.
- Entity merges (nightmare incrementally — re-pointing thousands of edges) are no-ops.
- "Rebuildable from Postgres" is exercised every cycle instead of rotting as a DR script.
- Old snapshots are free point-in-time debugging artifacts.
- Freshness SLA = rebuild cadence (start 6-hourly; tighten if missed).

---

## D8. Relation fact-label embeddings live in LanceDB, not in the graph

**Decision.** Each relation gets a canonical fact label ("Alice Novak works at Acme as VP of
Engineering") embedded in a Lance `relations` table keyed by `relation_id`, with scalar
columns (subject_id, predicate, object_id, validity window, evidence_count) for filtered
hybrid search. No vectors in the LadybugDB snapshot.

**Context.** Challenged ("is Lance really the best place?") and then verified against the
vendored LadybugDB source + official docs. Findings (detail in
`plan/analysis/ladybug_capabilities.md`):

1. **Hard blocker**: LadybugDB's HNSW vector index and BM25 FTS index support **node-table
   properties only** — relationship properties cannot be indexed. In-graph fact search would
   require reifying every relation as a node, roughly doubling the graph and contorting
   traversals.
2. **Snapshot economics**: 5–15M fact embeddings at 1024–1536 dims fp32 ≈ 20–90 GB inside
   every snapshot (vs. a few GB without) plus a full HNSW build per rebuild cycle — destroys
   the rebuild-and-ship model (D7).
3. **Lance exists regardless** for L1 chunks and L2 claims; one vector estate, one embedding
   pipeline, one index-maintenance regime.
4. **The avoided join is cheap**: top-k (~100s) relation_ids from Lance → ID-keyed
   expansion/BFS in the snapshot.

**Consequences.** Division of labor: Lance = entry (semantic + BM25 + scalar-filtered
candidate generation); LadybugDB = structure (expansion, paths, distance reranking, as-of
traversal). Revisit only if D7 changes *and* the node-only limitation disappears upstream.
The Lance relations table is derived state, rebuilt with the same guarantees as the snapshot.
Fact labels add a small write-side LLM cost (one sentence per relation, only on material
adjudication changes).

---

## D9. Search architecture: Graphiti-inspired, zero LLM calls on the query path

**Decision.** Parallel retrieval channels (semantic over Lance relations + claims, BM25,
lexical PG FTS, structured scalar lookups, registry entity resolution) fused with **RRF**;
reranked by **graph distance from focal entities** (native SHORTEST/BFS in the snapshot) and
**evidence count**; optional cross-encoder as a flagged final stage. Composable primitives
plus named **search recipes** (`relation_hybrid_rrf`, `relation_near_entity`,
`claims_verbatim`, …). Hard rule: no LLM calls in the core search path.

**Context.** Graphiti's search stack (edge-fact embeddings + BM25 + graph traversal, RRF
default, node-distance/episode-mentions/MMR/cross-encoder rerankers, canned recipes, no
query-time LLM — how Zep reaches ~300ms P95), adapted to our store layout: their edge-fact
embedding relocates to Lance (D8); their episode-mentions reranker is our `evidence_count`,
free from D2.

**Consequences.** Query latency is bounded by retrieval+rerank, not generation. Agents pick
strategies instead of assembling plumbing. Center-node reranking requires focal-entity
resolution first — the registry is on the hot path.

---

## D10. As-of traversal via projected graphs

**Decision.** Bi-temporal filtering during graph traversal is implemented with
`PROJECT_GRAPH_CYPHER` relationship predicates over the four temporal columns (project the
graph down to edges valid at `$as_of`, then traverse), since LadybugDB has no native temporal
query semantics.

**Context.** Verified: projected graphs accept rel-level Cypher predicates; nothing else in
the engine understands time.

---

## D11. Community detection runs externally

**Decision.** LadybugDB's algo extension ships PageRank, K-Core, and connected components but
**no Louvain/Leiden** (verified in `src/extension/extension_entries.cpp`). Community detection
runs as an external pass (igraph/graspologic) over the same Parquet export that feeds the
rebuild; results (community assignments, centrality) are written back to **Postgres**, keeping
the graph a projection (D6). Communities then serve as L3 refresh triggers ("claims in
community C changed") and salience priors.

---

## D12. Trigger model: per-document chain ends at L2; aggregates are debounced

**Decision.** L0→L1→L2 chain per document (Cloud Tasks). L3–L6 are *aggregate* layers
triggered by windows/debounce ("N new claims or T minutes"), with the rolling-window-delay
worker for hot files (index.md). Cloud Tasks: max 2 retries + dead-letter into Postgres;
idempotent workers keyed by content hash + processing version.

**Context.** "Trigger next layer when previous finishes" (v1) maps cleanly only to
per-document layers. L3+ summarize *across* documents; per-doc triggering of a serial
git-editing layer was the design's scaling bottleneck.

**Refined by D45.** The hot-file rolling-window-delay worker is superseded: the K compile driver
is the repo's only automated committer and compiles in dependency order, so hot files (the root
`index.md`) are simply the last DAG target, compiled once per cycle. The debounce/window trigger
model itself is unchanged.

**Refined by D56.** The idempotency discipline (content hash + processing version) extends one
level down: E2 keys on the **`extraction_input_hash`** (chunk text + the full context-bundle
fingerprint + extractor version), so re-ingesting an edited document re-extracts only the
changed chunks; embeddings key on (chunk content hash, embedding version). Same principle,
finer grain.

**Refined by D67.** "Max 2 retries" means one initial handler execution plus at most two
application retries: `processing_state.attempts` counts handler starts and its starting-point
`max_attempts` is three. Cloud Tasks retries transport delivery only; provider headers never
become the application counter or DLQ authority. Normalized backoff and budget-parking state lives
on the Postgres row.

---

## D13. LadybugDB accepted as the L6 engine (P2 after D14)

**Decision.** LadybugDB (maintained community successor of Kuzu after Kuzu Inc. was acquired
by Apple and open-source development stopped, October 2025) is the L6 base: embedded,
columnar, Cypher, native paths, Parquet/Arrow interop, read-only multi-process mode.

**Context.** Confirmed via web research and a survey of the vendored source tree
(`plan/analysis/ladybug_capabilities.md`). Risks accepted: young fork; vector/FTS/algo extension
implementations live in a separate repo (not vendored) — irrelevant to our usage since
vectors/FTS stay in Lance (D8) and the engine features we depend on (COPY FROM, paths,
projected graphs, read-only mode) are core, verified in source.

---

## D14. Naming: three planes (E/K/P) replace the L0–L6 ladder

> **Refined by D47 and D73.** The three-plane naming stands. D47 collapsed K into one
> mechanism; D73 withdrew the K3 tier, so current Plane K is K1 plus K2 purpose scopes. The
> mapping below records the historical transition from the L-number design.

**Decision.** The system is described as three planes, each with its own internal sequence,
because the plane — not the number — determines the operational rules (trigger model, source
of truth, mutability, rebuild semantics):

- **Plane E — Evidence** (per-document processing writing into global ledgers; Postgres is
  truth): **E0 files, E1 chunks, E2 claims, E3 relations**; plus the **entity and predicate
  registries** as explicit cross-cutting substrate (layers *transform*, registries
  *canonicalize*).
- **Plane K — Knowledge** (aggregate, LLM-compiled, debounced; git is truth): **K1 general,
  K2 special-purpose scopes, K3 core beliefs**.
- **Plane P — Projections** (derived, no authority, rebuilt on schedule, immutable
  snapshots): **P1 search indexes** (Lance), **P2 graph** (LadybugDB).

Mapping: L0→E0, L1→E1, L2→E2, L3→K1, L4→K2, L5→K3, L6→P2. Relations (E3) and the Lance
indexes (P1) previously had no name at all. L-numbers survive as colloquial shorthand;
"(formerly LX)" annotations are kept for one doc generation.

**Context.** Accepted objection O1 (`plan/analysis/objections.md`). The ladder implied a
single cascade of same-kind layers; in reality P2 is a projection of E3, not a level above
K3, and relations — the most load-bearing artifact — had no slot. Every recurring design
confusion was a plane-boundary violation: `claim_id`-on-edges (E3 vs P2), "each layer
triggers the next" (E rules applied to K), "is the graph rebuildable" (P semantics asked of
K). The asymmetry that the graph projection had a layer number while the vector indexes
didn't was a symptom of the same conflation.

**Consequences.** `requirements_v3` and `overall_design` reframed around planes;
`l6_graph_design.md` renamed `p2_graph_design.md`; future per-layer designs named by plane
(e2_claims, k_layers, …). O2 (collapsing K1–K3), if later accepted, becomes a change local to
plane K. Decision texts D1–D13 keep their original L-naming as historical record; the mapping
above translates.

---

## D15. Ontology: universal core + anchored extensions, on the registries

**Decision.** Users define their own ontology per problem; the system ships a small
best-effort core. Both live in the existing registries (D5) — ontology is content, not new
machinery:

- **Universal core, borrowed not invented**: ~8 entity types and ~10–15 predicates aligned
  with schema.org naming — *familiar, schema.org-aligned names + registry-rendered
  descriptions/examples* (LLMs interpret labels by pretrained semantics, so meaningful names
  beat arbitrary ones; **no measured schema.org-vs-good-synonym delta is claimed**). Concrete
  seed core fixed in D18.
- **Extension rule — extend, never fork**: every user-defined type declares a core parent
  (`ResearchPaper ⊂ Document`); predicates may too. This keeps blocking, graph queries, and
  cross-scope retrieval working at the core level over any custom domain.
- **Domain/range constraints** on predicates (`works_at: Person → Organization`) —
  lightweight typed columns that mechanically reject a class of extraction hallucinations.
- **Prompts render from the registry** (types/predicates/descriptions/examples): defining a
  scope = editing rows, not prompt engineering; prompt-version tracking (D12) captures
  ontology changes.
- **Deliberately not OWL**: parent-links + domain/range replicate most benefits without
  permanent reasoner/tooling cost. User-supplied OWL can be imported into the registry.

**Context.** Multiple K2 scopes are domain ontologies in disguise; a fixed universal ontology
either bloats or strangles them. The `other:` escape (D5) becomes the discovery/promotion
funnel. (An external-authority resolution tier was considered and later dropped — see D20.)
Three speeds, one registry: core (slow, each element a commitment) → scope extensions (fast,
each an experiment) → `other:` (ungoverned, monitored). Analysis:
`plan/analysis/entity_registry.md`.

**Consequences.** Adding types/predicates = inserting rows. Retyping is retroactively clean
in P2 thanks to rebuilds (D7). Only splitting heavily-used types/predicates is expensive —
hence the small core. Seed lists and constraint tables go to `registries_design.md`.

---

## D16. One graph, many lenses: scopes never get their own graph

**Decision.** Multiple K2 scopes (projects, team profiling, …) share one P2 graph and one
entity space. Scopes get, in increasing order of weight: (1) **ontology extensions** (D15) —
their vocabulary as a footprint in the shared graph; (2) **query-time scope views** via
`PROJECT_GRAPH_CYPHER` (verified LadybugDB capability), declared in the registry as
scope → predicate/type lists; (3) **materialized filtered snapshots** only if performance or
access isolation ever demands — emitted by the same P2 rebuild from the same Postgres export,
a second projection of the same truth, never a second graph.

**Context.** Separate per-domain graphs would re-fragment identity — the exact disease the
registry cures — and kill cross-scope queries ("which team members worked on projects
connected to X?"), which are the point of having a graph. Plane discipline: K2 scopes are
consumers of plane E, not owners; a scope owns its compiled markdown, never facts.

**Consequences.** New scope = git directory + registry rows (types/predicates + scope-view
definition) + extraction interests; never a new database. Rule of thumb: **scopes multiply;
truth doesn't.** Access-sensitive scopes (e.g. people profiles) are handled by filtered
snapshots + API-level authorization, not by forking storage. Scope-sharing applies *within*
one deployment only — separate deployments (assistant, agency, client projects, …) are fully
independent instances with separate entity spaces (`registries_design.md` §1, deployment
model).

**Refined by D50 (trust model).** The access-isolation arm ("filtered snapshots + API-level
authorization" for sensitive scopes) is withdrawn as *access control*: content-level
authorization inside a deployment is a library non-goal — a deployment is one trust domain,
and data with a different trust boundary belongs in a **separate deployment** (this decision's
own last sentence, promoted to the isolation mechanism). Filtered snapshots remain as the
scope-view / performance tool of arm (3).

> a committed constant — the spikes are listed in each SYNTHESIS §5.

## D17. Canonical resolution tier cascade (T0–T4), block-loose / decide-tight

**Decision.** One authoritative entity-resolution cascade, replacing the scattered/folklore
thresholds: **T0** exact match on the LLM-emitted canonical name form (§5/D19) → **T1** fuzzy
*blocking* (`pg_trgm` GIN, recall-first low floor — candidate generation, NOT a decision) →
**T2** phonetic (Daitch-Mokotoff, **not** Soundex) → **T3** embedding similarity (Lance, residue
only) → **T4** LLM adjudication (small→frontier) on the ambiguous middle band → human review for
high blast-radius. **Registry-self-contained — no 3rd-party external-authority tier (D20).** Each
tier's accept/reject bands are **per-type, golden-set-measured, versioned config** stamped with
`resolver_version`. No threshold ships without a per-type precision/recall curve.

**Context.** JW≥0.92 / cosine≥0.88 were folklore: JW 0.92 is Splink's per-field Bayes *evidence
level*, not an accept bar; benchmark spread (Magellan 98.4 clean vs 43.6 textual) proves no
global constant works. Graphiti independently arrived at the same block-loose/decide-tight shape.
(R2; refines D4.)

**Consequences.** LLM cost scales with ambiguity. Blocking sets a hard recall ceiling, so cheap
tiers *escalate* near-misses, never auto-reject. Feeds O6 (every threshold needs the golden set).

## D18. Ontology seed core — 8 types + 14 predicates, schema.org-anchored, domain/range not OWL

**Decision.** Seed core: 8 entity types (`Person`, `Organization`, `Place`, `Document` (a root
anchored to schema.org `CreativeWork`), `Event`, `Concept`, `Project`, `Product`) + 14 predicates with
`subject_type`/`object_type` columns
(`works_for, member_of, affiliated_with, located_in, part_of, authored, created, about,
knows_about, knows, participated_in, works_on, founded, related_to`). `related_to` is the
predicate-side core parent for extend-never-fork (D15). Time is bi-temporal edge metadata, never a
predicate or Date-node. Enforce domain/range exactly as Graphiti's `edge_type_map[(src,tgt)→[rel]]`
— the only structural ontology gate any surveyed production system ships. Schema.org property
mappings get a spot-check before freezing.

**Context.** Concretizes D15. Graphiti's `edge_type_map` is the validated mechanism; Cognee loads
OWL but enforces no domain/range. The "familiar names help extraction" claim is true in spirit
(pretrained semantics) but no measured schema.org-vs-synonym delta is asserted. (R5.)

**Consequences.** Work-shaped concepts (Task/Decision/Goal) stay out of the core but ship as a
system-provided **extension pack**, enabled per deployment — full entity status without a core
commitment; `Decision` standing rides on bi-temporal relations, so reversals are ordinary
supersession (`registries_design.md` §4, extension packs).

**Scope clarification (D41).** "Time is never a predicate or Date-node" governs the **relation/graph**
representation of time. A claim's immutable asserted-validity interval (D41) is *claim metadata*, not
a relation object/predicate or a Date-node, so it is fully compatible — D18 is unchanged.

**Refined by D64.** The seed core is now 8 types + **16** predicates: `uses`
(Person | Organization → Product) and `reports_to` (Person → Person) promoted from the
registries §4 watchlist — the first watchlist graduations. Everything else here is unchanged.

**Refined by D69.** The eight roots, all required/behavior-bearing row values, and all concrete
signatures are fixed by the inline registry manifest. `Document.parent_type = NULL` and its
`schema_org_ref` is `https://schema.org/CreativeWork`; `CreativeWork` is not a registry row.

## D19. Coref is satisfied inside the E2 extraction call (no dedicated model)

**Decision.** Coref is the guarantee that no claim leaves E2 with a dangling pronoun — satisfied
**inside the E2 extraction call, for all languages** (the LLM reads the chunk/document and writes
claims with referents resolved). **No dedicated coref model or pre-pass** (CorPipe/CorefUD).
Rationale: the extraction LLM is already called, so coref — a per-mention understanding task —
rides that call at ~zero marginal cost; a separate model would be a separate pass, separate
infra, and (CorPipe) a CC BY-NC-SA licensing exposure, to do something the LLM already does.

**Context.** Same family of decisions as entity typing (`registries_design.md` §4): per-mention
understanding (typing, coref, name-canonicalization) is free with extraction; only *at-scale
matching against the registry* (fuzzy/phonetic/embedding) needs non-LLM tiers. 6/6 surveyed
systems do coref in-call. The earlier "dedicated coref beats LLM by ~13 CoNLL F1" finding
compared older/constrained LLMs, not a frontier model extracting with full context; Czech and
other inflected languages are well-served by frontier LLMs in-context. (R1, R3; refines D4.)

**Consequences.** Cross-*document* coref ("the CEO" referring to an entity introduced in another
document) remains an open recall gap — it is not solved by intra-document coref of any kind
(LLM or model). If a *future* deployment's language is genuinely poorly served by frontier LLMs
(a low-resource language — not Czech), a specialized model could be reconsidered as a
per-deployment alternative — a documented option, not part of the system.

## D20. No 3rd-party external-authority tier — resolution is registry-self-contained

**Decision.** Entity resolution does **not** depend on 3rd-party external registries (Wikidata,
OpenAlex, DOI, ORCID, LEI, …). Identity is resolved entirely from the system's own data via the
T0–T4 cascade (D17). The earlier "tier-0 authority" idea is **dropped from scope.**

**Context.** Two reasons. (1) **Coverage:** public registries only know publicly-notable entities
(listed companies, published researchers, papers) — near-zero coverage for the actual target
deployments, whose data is internal/private/domain-specific (a manufacturer's internal systems,
a personal assistant's contacts, statutes, internal projects). (2) **Dependency:** they put an
external, rate-limited, license-encumbered service on a core write path for little return. The
research (R4) recommended them as an *optional, never-gating accelerator*; for these deployments
that accelerator rarely fires, so the simplicity of dropping it wins.

**Consequences.** The cascade starts at T0 = exact match on the LLM-emitted canonical name form.
The genuinely valuable "authority" case is **internal/domain authoritative IDs** (a source
system's own keys, legal citations) — *not* 3rd-party registries; that is a **future
per-deployment connector** (a documented alternative, not part of the system), which would attach such IDs as aliases (never as the
canonical `entity_id`). No `external_ids` table ships now.

## D21. Clustering algorithm + incremental procedure + reversibility records

**Decision.** Decision clustering = **connected-components-to-gather** (with a black-hole guard:
raise threshold + repartition above component size T) → **HAC distance-cut inside each blob**
(never bare transitive closure; never Louvain/Leiden for ER — that's D11 community detection).
Write-path incremental = max-both assignment + **nDR n=1** (re-cluster only the 1-hop neighborhood;
order-independent; n=2 only when a hub is touched). Reversibility state lives **only in Postgres**:
`resolution_decisions` (append-only, `superseded_by`), `merge_events` (append-only, pre-merge
membership snapshot), `merged_into` redirect chain, optional negative/exclusion edges. A
generic-identifier guard (Senzing) down-weights + re-evaluates an alias that suddenly links many.
P2 rebuild (D7) re-points edges on merge/un-merge for free.

**Context.** No OSS system (Splink/dedupe/Zingg/Graphiti) ships un-merge — building it in Postgres
is correct, not over-engineering. dedupe uses exactly HAC `linkage(centroid)`+`fcluster(distance)`
+ a `max_components` guard. (R8.)

## D22. Golden-set + evaluation plan

**Decision.** Two **separate** assets: a **golden EVAL set** (unbiased, measures P/R, tunes
thresholds) and a **training set** (built only if a learned matcher is ever added; AL-sampled,
biased, never used to measure). The eval set: ~200 human-verified labeled pairs/type (~100 hard
positives incl. synthetic father/son/inflection/married-name + ~100 hard negatives; ~400/type for
auto-merge-critical types), blocking-stratified positive over-sampling, **Wilson** CIs, per-tier
metrics, and a canary regression harness re-run per `resolver_version`. **Break the circularity:**
the cascade/LLM may *propose* candidate pairs, but measurement labels must be **human-adjudicated**.
The eval plan also covers the **retrieval half of O6** (recall@k per search recipe, rerank-weight
tuning, contradiction-detection precision). A learned matcher + active-learning training loop are
a documented **optional extension** of the cascade (D17), kept strictly separate from the eval
set — the core design resolves with the deterministic + LLM tiers, not a learned matcher.

**Context.** Closes O6's ER half concretely; the same eval set also seeds E2 Selection's
claim-verifiability golden set (D25 — junk-control moved to in-call Selection, not a salience gate).
(R7, O6.)

## D23. Registry scale & schema

**Decision.** The partition estate has exactly nine parents. Seven large append-only tables use
monthly RANGE partitions managed by `pg_partman`: `mentions(created_at)`,
`resolution_decisions(decided_at)`, `chunks(created_at)`, `chunk_claims(created_at)`,
`claims(ingested_at)`, `claim_extraction_decisions(decided_at)`, and
`testimony_currency_events(occurred_at)`. Two evidence joins use static HASH partitions:
`relation_evidence` by `relation_id` with PRIMARY KEY (`relation_id`, `claim_id`), and
`observation_evidence` by `observation_id` with PRIMARY KEY (`observation_id`, `claim_id`). Each
HASH parent has 64 migration-created children; 64 is a measured starting point, not a committed
constant. The hot partitioned tables remain btree-only to cap write amplification.

Do **not** partition `entities`/`aliases` (the blocking targets, ≤10⁷). Under D68's
schema-/database-per-deployment contract, the blocking GIN indexes are single-column:
`ix_entities_name_trgm` on `entities USING gin (normalized_name gin_trgm_ops)`,
`ix_aliases_lemma_trgm` on `aliases USING gin (normalized_lemma gin_trgm_ops)`, and
`ix_aliases_lemma_dm` on `aliases USING gin (daitch_mokotoff(normalized_lemma))`. The alias key is
`normalized_lemma`, not `normalized_name`. Keep the btree composite
`(subject_entity_id, predicate[, object])` on `relations`. Supersession + tiers T0–T2 run in
Postgres; embedding tier T3 in Lance (D8); HNSW never in OLTP. Load-test a representative corpus
slice before revising partition cadence, HASH child count, or index choices. Size row counts and
the load test against full, ungated extraction volume (D25).

**Context.** Monthly partitioning fits append-only rows whose transaction time correlates with
their access path. It does not fit `relation_evidence`: evidence for one relation accumulates over
that relation's lifetime, so month cannot prune the hot `relation_id → evidence` lookup and cannot
support the evidence-once primary key. HASH partitioning makes that lookup prune to one child and
lets Postgres enforce the pair uniqueness directly. The static observation-evidence family uses
the same access pattern. The large evidence tables are never fuzzy-scanned; fuzzy blocking stays
on the unpartitioned registry targets. (R9; `postgres_schema_design.md` §§9, 9.A, 12.)

## D24. Review tooling — build a thin Postgres-backed cluster-review queue

**Decision.** **Build** (don't adopt as system-of-record) a thin CLI cluster-review queue over
Postgres; no OSS tool offers cluster-queue + append-only reversible verdicts + provenance +
blast-radius gating. Review **clusters, not pairs** (pairwise is quadratic); route only the
`expected_impact = blast_radius × (1 − confidence)` middle band to humans; high-degree hub merges
never auto-accept. Borrow Splink's waterfall (evidence panel), Zingg's 3-way verdict (ergonomics),
OpenRefine's cluster-card-with-exclude (interaction). Every action appends a reversible,
provenance-stamped, redirect-preserving record (D21). The design is the CLI queue; a web UI /
Argilla is an optional addition if review volume ever justifies it, not part of the core design.
(R10.)

## D25. No pre-extraction value/salience gate — junk-control is in-call at E2 Selection + D2

**Decision.** There is **no E1.5 stage and no value/salience gate**. Plane E is `E0 → E1 → E2 → E3`;
every document that survives chunking is fully extracted. Junk-control moves to where junk is cheapest
and safest to identify: **E2 Selection** (Claimify proposition-level verifiability KEEP/REWRITE/DROP,
in-call, zero marginal LLM calls — the ablation-proven highest-leverage stage, element-coverage
macro-F1 83.7→54.4 when removed) and **D2** (corpus redundancy collapses into one relation +
`evidence_count`, so duplicate *facts* cost nothing in the graph). Exact-content-hash dedup remains as
the **D12/D7 idempotency** mechanism (a `content_hash` short-circuit at the worker boundary), never as a
value tier. The E0 **PageIndex section path/role is fed into the E2 call** so Selection can drop
references/boilerplate/intro/conclusion at proposition grain (the structural signal is *absorbed into*
extraction, not used as a binary pre-skip).

**Context.** O3's *premise* (most raw content is low-value; junk poisons downstream) is **accepted**;
its proposed *mechanism* (a pre-extraction gate) is **rejected**. The only "value" rung (a distilled
salience classifier) is unbuilt and golden-set-dependent; the novelty rung is a corpus-scale ANN at 10⁸
claims (the gate's own #1 self-defeat risk — it becomes a new fleet-scale stage); the honest cost lever
is ~1.5–2×, not 10×, and the 10× lived entirely in the DEFERRED tier whose two Postgres state tables +
transactional outbox + `SKIP LOCKED` queue + heartbeat reconciler + four promotion triggers are pure
complexity for that 1.5–2×. Claimify's Selection ablation makes the in-call verifiability filter the
highest-leverage junk control and it is free; D2 already neutralizes redundant-fact cost. The gate also
concentrated the system's highest-severity correctness risk (the zombie-fact / supersession-skip case —
silently withholding the only superseding evidence) and the circular never-defer-by-predicate problem;
extracting every section removes that failure mode at its root. (O3 premise; value_gate_research V1–V6;
claimify_research C4/C8.)

**Consequences.**
- Plane E reverts to `E0→E1→E2→E3` (`overall_design.md` §4). Paying E2 on everything is the ~1.5–2× the
  gate would have saved; Selection's in-call precision means that spend buys *clean* claims.
- **R9 / D23 re-stamp:** the three 10⁸ tables (`mentions` / `resolution_decisions` /
  `relation_evidence`) are sized against **full extraction** again (`f_full = 1`); the favorable gate
  shrink is withdrawn and R9's partition/index load-test plans against ungated volume.
- The E1.5 design doc is retired; `plan/designs/e2_e3_claims_relations_design.md` §4 records the
  non-goal (why there is no value gate) and what handles junk instead.
- The recall-conservative discipline (defer-don't-DROP) relocates one grain down, to E2 Selection (the
  claim-layer D35 proposal): conservative KEEP bias, never-drop lexical classes, `kept_flagged` (no hard
  delete), DROP ledger, per-fact canary CI.
- **Future option (documented, not built):** if a corpus slice ever shows extraction cost is dominated
  by structurally-skippable sections, a *trivial deterministic* section filter
  (`pageindex_node_type NOT IN {references, bibliography, nav, boilerplate, legal}` on E2 entry — no
  classifier, no ANN, no defer machinery) is the cheap add-back, gated on a measured break-even. This is
  explicitly **not** a smart gate.

## D26. *(withdrawn — folded into D25)*

Was "the gate is a nested cheap-first cascade" (T-dup → T-struct → T-novel → T-salience). Withdrawn
with the gate (D25). The cheap-first philosophy survives unchanged in D4 (supersession) and D17
(resolution). Exact-content-hash dedup survives as plain D12/D7 idempotency, not a value tier.

## D27. *(withdrawn — folded into D25)*

Was "defer decision is durable, versioned Postgres state." There is no defer decision; the
`gate_decisions` / `document_extraction_state` / `salience_gate_versions` tables are not built.

## D28. *(withdrawn — folded into D25)*

Was "lazy promotion triggers." No DEFERRED tier, so no promotion. K2 scope-interest (D16) remains a
query/compile-time selection over fully-extracted facts, never a promotion trigger.

## D29. *(withdrawn — folded into D25)*

Was "defer-don't-DROP recall envelope." The recall-conservative discipline relocates one grain down to
E2 Selection (the claim-layer D35 proposal): conservative KEEP bias, never-drop lexical classes,
`kept_flagged` (no hard delete), an append-only DROP ledger, per-fact canary CI — defer-don't-DROP at
the proposition grain, where junk is actually identifiable.

## D30. *(withdrawn — folded into D25)*

Was "gate cost & break-even discipline." No gate to cost. The break-even discipline survives as a
property of E2 spend (the claimify cost model) and of the documented trivial structural-skip add-back
(D25, future option).

## D31. E2 is a Claimify-staged extractor over a context bundle (two calls)

**Decision.** Claim extraction runs over a **context bundle** (target chunk + document header +
PageIndex section path + the E1 context prefix + ±N same-section neighbour chunks + entity hints),
never a bare chunk. The model does three jobs: **Selection** (keep only specific, verifiable
propositions; drop opinion / advice / hypothetical / generic / intro-conclusion / lack-of-info; keep
only the verifiable span of a mixed sentence), **Disambiguation/decontextualization** (resolve
references from the bundle and *only* the bundle; add the minimum context; discard when there is no
confident reading; coref in-call per D19), and **Decomposition** (atomic, attribution-preserving
claims). It runs as **two calls** (Selection separate from a fused decontextualize + decompose + ground
call); a one-call collapse is permitted only after an ablation. The literal three-calls-per-sentence
loop is not used at scale.

**Context.** Refines D4 (cheap-first) and realizes D19 (coref in-call). Selection is split out because
it is the highest-leverage stage and carries the opposite instruction to decontextualization. Design +
worked example: `plan/designs/e2_e3_claims_relations_design.md`. (C1–C8.)

**Refined by D58 (batched extraction).** The two-call shape applies to a **batch window** (a
section's contiguous chunks in one call pair) exactly as to a single chunk — the window is the
extraction unit, the calls are still two; bookkeeping stays per-chunk (per-chunk
`processing_state` commits keyed by `extraction_input_hash`; the batch's calls billed to the
claiming row — refined 2026-07-18).
`e1_chunks_design.md` §6.

## D32. Claim grounding is layered and dual-field, not verbatim-substring

**Decision.** A claim stores both a standalone `claim_text` and a verbatim `source_span` + character
offsets, plus an `added_context[]` list naming each added substring's bundle source. Acceptance layers,
cheapest first: (1) deterministic **anchor** — the source span is a real slice of the chunk; (2)
deterministic **window-membership** — every added substring verbatim-exists in its declared bundle
source (rejects fabrication); (3) an in-call **entailment self-verdict** (incl. the "*X said* Y entails
*X said Y*, not *Y*" rule); (4) a **sampled independent** entailment audit (never per-claim). Replaces
the verbatim-substring gate, which is incompatible with decontextualization. No external knowledge.

**Context.** A decontextualized claim is a rewrite, so it is never a verbatim substring; grounding must
be provenance + entailment, as every surveyed decompose-then-verify system does. (C6.)

**Refined by D65 (media).** For media-derived documents grounding is **two hops**: the anchor
(layer 1) proves the claim derives from the *representation* (document.md); it cannot prove the
ASR heard or the VLM saw correctly. The layer-4 sampled audit therefore becomes
**modality-aware** — the auditor listens to the referenced time interval / looks at the
referenced frame or region, never only the derived Markdown (which would grade the converter
against its own output). `plan/designs/media_design.md` §4.

## D33. E2 selection-drops and decontextualization edits are append-only, versioned state

**Decision.** Every Selection drop (with reason) and every decontextualization edit is written to an
append-only, version-stamped `claim_extraction_decisions` table. Rebuild reads stored claims +
decisions and never re-calls the model (the LLM rungs are replay-from-storage, like any
non-deterministic stage — D7); the per-chunk worker is idempotent on content-hash + extractor version
(D12). Drops become auditable and recoverable (a better prompt re-examines only the drop set), and the
eval metrics come for free.

**Context.** The same durable-state discipline the resolution and supersession layers use, applied to
the extraction transcript. (C8.)

## D34. E2 Selection is the value filter — there is no pre-extraction value gate

**Decision.** Junk-control lives at the **proposition grain**, in-call: Selection (D31) decides
**verifiability** — not relevance (handled by K2 scope views, D16) and not ambiguity (the
disambiguation step). Together with **D2** redundancy-collapse (duplicate facts → one relation +
`evidence_count`) and exact-content-hash idempotency (D12), this replaces the pre-extraction value/
salience gate, which is **not built** (D25). Selection's metrics stand alone.

**Context.** The chunk-level value gate (former D26–D30) was over-engineered for a ~1.5–2× lever and
concentrated the worst correctness risk; the in-call verifiability filter is cheaper, safer, and
ablation-proven. (D25; value_gate_research; claimify_research C4.)

**Refined by D59.** The opinion-drop narrows to *unattributed* opinion: a stance attributed to a
resolvable holder is a verifiable proposition about the holder and is kept, normalizing to a
holder-anchored observation. Verifiability remains the keep/drop line — attribution is what
makes a stance verifiable.

## D35. Selection recall envelope (defer-don't-DROP, one grain down)

**Decision.** Because a Selection drop is a hard delete with no second-copy net for a uniquely-attested
fact, Selection biases **conservative KEEP**; protects **never-drop classes** (quantities, dates,
named-entity + predicate, change-of-state language) regardless of phrasing; offers a low-confidence
**`kept_flagged`** outcome (mark-for-review, not delete); records all drops in the D33 ledger for
version-filtered re-examination; and is tuned against **per-fact** false-drop (canary CI), never a
corpus average.

**Context.** Mirrors the recall-conservative discipline the dropped gate carried (former D29), relocated
to the grain where junk is actually identifiable. (C4; D33.)

> Numbers/choices are starting points to measure (CLAUDE.md), not committed constants.

## D36. E0 is the document layer — a chain of idempotent sub-workers, not a renumber

**Decision.** E0 stays a single product layer (*files / structured document*) implemented as a short
chain of separately-idempotent, separately-observable sub-workers: **ingest** (store raw + hash) →
**convert** (raw → Markdown) → **structure** (PageIndex tree + roles + spans + summaries + placement
hint) → **crossref** (citations / document links). PageIndex post-processing is **not** promoted to a
top-level stage; E1/E2/E3 are **not** renumbered.

**Context.** The E-numbers name *product layers* (files → chunks → claims → relations); PageIndex
structure is metadata *about the document*, before chunking, so it belongs to E0. Renumbering would
churn every doc that references E1–E3 for no architectural gain (the L→E rename cost is the cautionary
precedent). Each sub-worker keys idempotency on `content_hash + its own version` (D12) so a single
config change doesn't rerun the whole chain.

**Consequences.** E0's output contract is unchanged (durable artifacts + queryable structure, ready
for E1). Operational complexity is handled by decomposition, not numbering.

## D37. E0 storage split — GCS holds bodies, Postgres holds the index; ID-addressed; mount-ready

> **Refined by D51.** The raw bucket's "never mounted" arm is reversed: raw is now mounted
> read-only but **off the navigation path** (explicit pointers only), with mandatory data-access
> audit logging and mime-routed storage classes (so "cold" is no longer blanket). The storage
> split, ID-addressing, and Postgres-metadata rules below are unchanged. Rationale in D51 and
> `e0_files_design.md` §2/§5.
>
> **Refined by D55.** `content_hash` identifies a document **version** (deduplicated as a
> content object); the *logical document* is a **lineage** identified by connector-native
> `(source_kind, source_ref)`, with append-only version rows. The GCS layout
> (`<doc_id>/<content_hash>/…`) already anticipated exactly this. `UNIQUE(deployment,
> content_hash)` moves to the content-object/version level. Rationale in D55 and
> `evidence_lifecycle_design.md` §2.

**Decision.** Two GCS buckets per deployment: a **raw** bucket (immutable originals, cold, strict
IAM, **never mounted**) and an **artifacts** bucket (Markdown + `pageindex.json` + conversion
sidecars, standard storage, reachable from the mounted corpus filesystem). Canonical objects are
**ID-addressed** (`doc_id` + `content_hash`), never title-addressed. **Postgres never stores document
body/Markdown text** — only compact query-critical metadata (identity, versions, state, artifact
URIs, hashes, costs, and the section index: titles/paths/roles/spans/summaries). `content_hash`
(sha256 of raw bytes) is the idempotency key (D12) and the only surviving dedup (idempotency, not a
value tier — D25).

**Context.** Postgres is the E-plane ledger; GCS is the blob store. Storing 1M document bodies in
Postgres bloats it for nothing and puts text where agents can't mount it. The precise rule (bodies in GCS, queryable metadata in Postgres) keeps the spine queryable while the
text lives where it can be mounted.

**Consequences.** Postgres stays lean; the artifact store is mount-friendly (D40); a converter
change re-converts by version (D7).

## D38. Configurable raw → Markdown conversion module

**Decision.** A pluggable, **configurable** conversion module (a reusable open-source library):
interface `convert(bytes, mime, hints) -> { markdown, blocks[] }` where `blocks` carry **page +
character offsets back to the source** (load-bearing for E2 grounding D32, chunking, PageIndex). A
**router** selects a converter by input type per-deployment config (digital PDF → text extract;
scanned/complex PDF + images → OCR e.g. Mistral OCR; office/html/email → markitdown; text →
passthrough). **Versioned** (`converter_version`): a converter/routing change re-converts affected
docs and rebuilds downstream.

**Context.** Conversion quality gates the whole pipeline, so it is pinned and reprocessable.
Generalizes common practice (Mistral OCR for PDFs, markitdown elsewhere) into a routing table. (User
proposal.)

**Refined by D57.** `blocks[]` moves **out** of the converter contract: converters are
heterogeneous (Mistral OCR exposes only per-page Markdown; markitdown plain Markdown), so the
contract weakens to what every tool can deliver — `document.md` + a **page map** + `media[]` —
and a single shared, deterministic **blockizer** (ours, `blockizer_version`) derives the block
sequence from `document.md`. Offsets into document.md stay exact (grounding, D32); source
back-pointers become best-effort provenance tiers. The conversion route is pinned per lineage.
`e1_chunks_design.md` §2.

**Refined by D65 (media).** The router gains three media routes (audio → diarized ASR; video →
ASR + adaptive keyframes + optional shot notes; standalone picture → VLM description behind a
document-vs-picture discriminator), and the contract generalizes once more: the page map
becomes a **source map** (character intervals → typed locators: page / image region / time
range / video region) and the output adds a **manifest** recording route, models, versions,
and per-section derivation labels — `convert(bytes, mime, hints) → { document.md, source_map,
derived_assets[], manifest }`. `plan/designs/media_design.md` §2/§4.

## D39. PageIndex provides per-document structure — sidecar + PG index, structure-only, summaries kept, placement-hint-extended

**Decision.** PageIndex builds a per-document hierarchical tree (`node_id`, `title`, `summary`,
nested nodes, spans). It is used as **structure, not a retrieval engine** (we keep chunk + embed +
graph, D8/D9). Stored **both** as a `pageindex.json` sidecar (artifact) **and** a Postgres
`document_sections` index (queryable path/role/span per chunk for E1/E2). **Per-section summaries are
kept** (cheap, per-section) as **context never facts** — feeding E1 prefixes, navigation, and
selection-explainability; the corpus's *global* high-level picture remains the K plane's job, so it
never depends on summary quality. The PageIndex output is **extended with a `placement` hint**: a
proposed path for the document (and key sections) in the corpus's hypothetical directory tree —
advisory input to the P3 projection (D40), not a commitment.

**Context.** Structure is load-bearing (section-aware chunk boundaries + the E2 role signal); summaries
are cheap polish worth measuring, not deleting on intuition. The placement hint lets E0 seed the
corpus filesystem (P3, D40) — a per-document path guess produced where the document is freshly
understood, reconciled into a coherent tree by the projection.

**Refined by D57 (representation).** Sections are persisted as **block ranges** on the
deterministic block grid (a snap rule normalizes PageIndex's LLM-drawn spans into a well-formed
partition; sections never cut through a block; blocks are never derived from sections). The
tool, roles, summaries, and placement hints are unchanged. `e1_chunks_design.md` §3.

## D40. P3 — the corpus filesystem: a mountable, rebuildable projection

**Decision.** The system builds a **canonical corpus filesystem** (a published navigable view, no source-of-truth): a materialized **GCS bucket
laid out as a directory tree** organizing the whole corpus for agent navigation, **mounted read-only**
to agentic workers (`gcsfuse`). It is a **P-plane projection** (P3) — derived, holds no
source-of-truth, **rebuilt from Postgres + document artifacts**, like P1/P2. A projection worker
materializes/maintains the tree from the **placement hints** (D39) + entities/relations + the K-plane
structure: folders by topic/source/time/entity, leaves linking to per-document artifacts, a generated
`_index.md` / `llms.txt` at each level. K (compiled understanding) and P3 (navigable index over
sources) cross-link and compose; they are not duplicates.

**Context.** Agentic consumers need to browse the memory as a filesystem, which requires a navigable
corpus tree. Cross-document organization is a function of evolving knowledge, so it must be a
**rebuildable projection** (P3), not E0 state — per-document structure is E0 (intrinsic), corpus
organization is P3 (derived). Realizes the "extend PageIndex with placement → projection materializes
a mounted bucket tree" design.

**Consequences.** Agents browse a stable, navigable hierarchy and drill into raw sources; the tree
reorganizes as the corpus grows without touching truth (placement hints are inputs). New projection in
plane P alongside P1 (search) and P2 (graph).

**Refined (P3↔K reconciliation — closes `questions.md` #25).** The phrase "+ the K-plane
structure" above is corrected: **K is a cross-link, not a structural input** — P3's *shape* is
built from Postgres (placement hints, entities/relations) + the E0 artifacts only, per the
binding `e0_files_design.md` §6. This keeps P3 rebuildable from the E spine (it does not
inherit the K repo's source-of-truth burden or its deletion-manifest reach); P3 `_index.md`
files and K pages link to each other, in both directions, as consumers — never as inputs.

---

## D41. Claims carry an immutable, source-asserted validity interval (asserted vs. adjudicated time)

**Decision.** A claim gains a structured **world-time interval as the source asserted it** —
`claim_valid_from` / `claim_valid_until`, plus a `claim_valid_precision` (year/quarter/day/…/open/
unknown) and a `claim_valid_kind` (proposition-validity vs. event-time vs. measurement-period). It is
the structured form of the date decontextualization already resolves into the claim text ("launched
*in 2024*"), emitted in the same E2 call and **grounded** by the existing window-membership check (the
date must verbatim-exist in the bundle, D32). It is **evidence about *when***, epistemically identical
to `claim_text` (evidence about *what*) and `source_span` (evidence about *where in the source*).
Adjudicated, current-fact validity stays **exclusively on relations** (`valid_from`/`valid_until` +
`invalidated_at`, D3).

**Why this is not a second validity authority** (stated so a future reader need not re-derive it).
Three *mechanical* properties — not the `_asserted_` naming — keep claim-validity from competing with
the relation window:

1. **Immutable** — no `UPDATE` path, no `invalidated_at`, no `status`, no `superseded_by`. A column
   that cannot be revised cannot be "current belief."
2. **Many-valued per fact** — N sources may assert N different, even contradictory, windows and *all
   stand forever*. Many-valued-by-source is the signature of *evidence* (like `evidence_count`'s N
   rows); a belief authority is single-valued-by-fact.
3. **No fact-identity** — keyed only by `claim_id`, never addressable as "the validity of fact F," so
   it structurally cannot answer "fact F is true at T."

So D3's "absurd task" never returns: a contradicting source makes a **new** claim with its own
immutable window; nothing ever closes an existing claim's window. The relation adjudicator **may
consult** `claim_valid_*` as one evidence input (better than re-parsing claim text) but the relation
window stays its *computed, recorded, monotonic* verdict — never a reduction over claim columns, never
read back to override the verdict, never reopened by a late-arriving retrospective.

**Context.** World-validity windows previously lived only on relations, but **many claims yield no
relation by design** (D2: n-ary facts; single-entity / attribute facts; literal- or quantity-object
facts like "revenue was \$5M in FY2023" — objects must be entities and time is never a value, D18). For
those, the fact's world-time survived only inside NL claim text, unqueryable. An immutable asserted
interval on the claim closes that gap without a Date-node, a literal-object relation, or claim
supersession. Converged recommendation of an independent Codex analysis, a four-angle internal design
workflow, and an adversarial "amend-the-decisions" review — the last of which, tasked to argue *for*
restructuring, concluded the claim/relation split, D6, and relation-only supersession should all stay.

**Consequences.**
- New evidence-grain retrieval: a `claims_as_of(t)` search recipe answers "what did sources assert held
  over T," over Lance scalar columns, zero LLM (D9). Belief-as-of stays relations-only (D10); the recipe
  registry/linter **bars** `claims_as_of` from answering "currently true."
- The relation adjudicator gets structured temporal inputs (a claim "Alice joined in March 2024" can
  seed `works_for.valid_from`; "Alice left in January 2026" can seed closure) instead of re-parsing
  text — with a monotonicity guard so a late retrospective cannot move an adjudicated window.
- **Refines D3 and D6 in wording, not substance**: claims may carry an *immutable* interval, never a
  *revisable* one; validity-as-current-fact still has exactly one home. **Compatible with D18** —
  the interval lives on the claim, not as a relation object/predicate or Date-node (D18 governs
  relation/edge time and is untouched).
- **Residual non-goal (documented):** two sources asserting *incompatible* windows for a
  **non-relational** fact both stand as evidence with no relation to host a contradiction/verdict;
  retrieval surfaces both. Structured *supersession of non-relational restatements* is **not** in the
  claims plane — a fact that needs an adjudicated current value is promoted to a relation (the D5
  `other:` funnel), or a future "E3 proposition-fact layer" is added. Recurrence ("every Q4") and
  un-datable anchor-events ("as of the merger") are out of the single-interval model; the documented
  upgrade is an expressivity child table (btree-indexed, D23-restamped), built only on measured demand.

## D42. E0 records document origin at ingestion (external vs. system-generated)

**Decision.** Every input gets an immutable `origin` stamped at **E0 ingest** — at minimum
distinguishing **external** (came from outside the system boundary) from **self/system-generated**
(produced by this deployment's own agents or workers — e.g. an email an operating agent sent).
Capture only; no consuming logic is built now.

**Context.** Provenance — "did this document come from the world, or from us?" — is knowable *only*
at the moment of ingestion; once a document is chunked → claimed (E2) → related (E3), self-generated
and external assertions are indistinguishable. The motivating case is a closed agent-driven loop where
the system's own outputs are re-ingested: without an origin stamp, an agent's own assertions inflate
`evidence_count` (D2) and entrench beliefs (K3) as if independently corroborated — a silent
self-confirmation loop that corrupts the corpus's headline confidence signal. This is the one piece of
that scenario with a **capture-now-or-lose-it** asymmetry; everything else it raises
(operational-state scopes, an E→K signal/interrupt channel, decision↔evidence-snapshot links) is
additive — a **documented scope boundary** whose admission condition is an agent-operations
deployment actually existing, not a phase marker.

**Consequences.** A small, mandatory E0 metadata field (extensible to richer origin classes and
per-action lineage grouping when needed). The intended first consumer — confidence/belief math that
counts *independent external* evidence rather than raw `evidence_count`, discounting self-generated
echoes — is a **documented non-goal** (a scope boundary with a named admission condition: build it
when belief math is designed, unblocked by this capture). No change to D2/D3/D6.

**Refined by D45–D47 (the K trigger surface).** One of the deferred items — the **E→K
signal/interrupt channel** — is now designed, its condition met (an agent-operated deployment is a
named target): routing-rule **subscriptions** with a **dispatch** consequence invoke registered
agentic workflows with debounced, delta-carrying payloads; page-level watches serve authored
consumers (`k_layers_design.md` §5). Origin capture itself is unchanged, and it is what keeps the
resulting loop non-circular — a re-ingested plan is stamped system-generated and never counts as
independent external evidence. The other boundary items (operational-state scopes,
decision↔evidence-snapshot links) remain documented non-goals.

## D43. Two canonical layers — typed relations for the graph, an untyped entity-anchored observation layer for non-graph facts; supersession by entity-blocking + adjudication

**Decision.** Plane E keeps **two** canonical fact layers, split by what they *are*, not merged:

1. **Relations** (unchanged, D2–D5/D18) — distinct **entity→entity** facts with a *governed predicate*.
   Typed because a graph needs typed edges; this is the only layer that projects to P2 (the graph).
2. **Observations** (new) — facts asserted about **one entity** whose object is a *value or a statement*,
   not another entity ("Acme's headcount is 600", "Acme's FY2023 revenue was \$5M"). An observation is
   **anchored to a resolved entity** and is **not typed by any governed attribute vocabulary**. It
   carries the same **bi-temporal** validity windows as a relation, so non-relational facts finally get
   first-class temporal validity and supersession (the gap relations-only left).

**The slot is found, not declared.** Supersession/contradiction among observations reuses the exact
pattern relations already use — *blocking + cheap-first adjudication* (D4) — but blocks on the
**resolved entity** (an exact key) instead of a `(subject, predicate)` pair: a new value-claim about
entity *E* → fetch *E*'s live observations (indexed; exhaustive for that entity) → for a hub entity with
many, narrow by **semantic similarity** over the observation label (P1/Lance) → the adjudicator decides
per candidate (each gated on a **positive same-thing match** judged *semantically* from the `statement` —
same property, and for a period figure same period and value-compatibility — exactly as relations judge
"same predicate", with **no typed value/period column**): **supersede** (cap the prior `valid_until` at
the new `valid_from`), **contradict/coexist** (same property + same period, incompatible value → both
stand, shared `contradiction_group`), **evidence** (same property + value → add evidence, collapse
redundancy), or **new**. The **no-cap rule** carries the period distinction without a column:
`valid_from`/`valid_until` is the **world-validity of the belief**, and only a **changing effective
state** (headcount/balance/status) is ever capped; a **measurement / fixed-period figure** ("FY2023
revenue") is **never** capped — it doesn't stop being true at period-end, its window stays open, and a
conflicting same-period figure coexists. The conflict slot is `entity + same-property + same-period`, all
matched semantically (FY2023 *revenue* \$5M vs \$7M conflict; FY2023 revenue vs FY2023 *profit*, or FY2023
vs Q1-2023, do not). The "never silently resolve" property is a
**binding adjudicator contract** (supersede only on a positively-matched prior above an explicit margin,
with a persisted reason; otherwise coexist) **plus an eval gate** — not a schema invariant. The design is
explicit that this is policy, and that it fails toward *duplicate coexisting rows*, never silent
overwrite.

**Context.** Non-relational facts (values, measures, single-entity properties) need temporal validity
and supersession — relations couldn't hold them (a relation's object must be an entity), and surfacing
them statelessly is information-lossy. Two fuller alternatives were explored and **rejected** (their
work is preserved in closed PRs, not on main):
- *A unified, typed `facts` table* (one table for entity- and literal-object facts, supersession gated
  by a registered relationship type + a governed `value_domain`/`cardinality` vocabulary). Rejected:
  it merges graph and non-graph data under one roof — a heavy mental model — and the per-attribute
  typing (`value_domain`, `unit_dimension`, `cardinality`) must be LLM-inferred, is brittle, and adds
  registry-maintenance cost. The typing existed only to make literal supersession *schema-enforced*; if
  supersession is adjudicated (as relations always have been), the typing is unnecessary.
- *Mutating claims to carry validity.* Rejected (D3): it destroys the immutable evidence record and
  faces the "absurd task" of closing every prior claim. The observation row is the right unit of
  supersession — one window closes, N immutable claims stay as evidence.

The **D6 "one belief home"** objection does **not** apply to two tables here: a relation and an
observation can never represent the *same* belief (entity-object vs value-object are disjoint), so they
cannot drift against each other the way a relation and a duplicate "proposition-fact" could. Two
disjoint canonical layers, not one polymorphic table, is the simpler correct shape.

**Consequences.**
- **Relations are untouched** — typed, governed, graph-projected, with their existing `(s,p,o)` blocking
  and overlap-EXCLUDE.
- **Observations are deliberately lean** — entity-anchored, bi-temporal, evidence-linked. The value and
  any reporting period live in the NL `statement` (matched semantically); there is **no governed
  attribute registry, no `value_domain`/`unit_dimension`/`cardinality`, no structured value/period
  column, and no typed EXCLUDE.** Supersession is the adjudicator's job (CI-gated), not a schema
  invariant. (A structured `value` for cross-entity numeric range scans is an additive change if that
  need ever becomes real — deliberately omitted now.)
- **No semantic-clustering recall hole.** Because observations are anchored to a *resolved entity*
  (exact key), every prior observation about that entity is found by the exact block — semantic search
  only *ranks* candidates for a hub entity; it never gates membership. The only residual fuzziness is
  the supersede-vs-coexist *judgment*, which fails safe to coexist.
- **Retrieval is through projections** (D9): observations are embedded in P1/Lance (semantic + value
  search; entity-anchored timelines); they **never** enter the P2 graph (D18 holds — a value is not a
  node). The canonical layer is storage; projections serve queries.
- **Claims stay immutable** (D2/D3), entity-linked (mentions), with asserted validity (D41) feeding an
  observation's initial window.
- The "never silently resolve" guarantee moves from a (would-be) schema gate to an **adjudicator
  fail-safe + eval gate** — the rigor lives in E3/eval, not the DDL.

Design: `plan/designs/observations_design.md`. Schema: `postgres_schema_design.md` §9.A. Normalization:
`e2_e3_claims_relations_design.md` §5. Open items (qualitative/opinion belief — still an *upstream* E2
question; the enforcement dial) tracked in `questions.md`.

## D44. The P2 projection contract — Postgres `v_graph_*` views are the LadybugDB COPY boundary; merge-redirect + keep-retracted + casts live in Postgres

**Decision.** The Postgres→LadybugDB (P2) projection is defined by a set of read-only **Postgres views**
(`v_graph_entities`, `v_graph_documents`, `v_graph_relates`, `v_graph_mentioned_in`, `v_graph_crossref`,
`v_graph_is_document`, + the shared `v_graph_survivor`) — `postgres_schema_design.md` §10.A. The LadybugDB
side is then a trivial `COPY <T> FROM SQL_QUERY('pg', 'SELECT * FROM v_graph_<t>')` (or the same view via
the Parquet hop). The graph model is **one `Entity` node + one `Document` node**, and **one generic
`RELATES` rel table with `predicate` as a property** (+ structural `MENTIONED_IN`, `DOC_CROSSREF`,
`IS_DOCUMENT`) — *not* per-type node tables or per-predicate rel tables (the vocabulary is governed,
extensible registry data, not DDL; D5/D15/D18). Entity ids stay native **`UUID`** primary keys.

**Context.** A full multi-agent analysis (Codex + Antigravity, both source-verified against the LadybugDB
tree, + an internal multi-angle workflow, both review rounds) confirmed the Postgres structures transfer
**cleanly** *because* the graph is a dumb projection (D6): it inherits outcomes (a believed
`(subject, predicate, object)` fact + validity windows), never constraints — so generated columns, EXCLUDE
arms, composite FKs, and the D18 domain/range signatures correctly **stay in Postgres**. The transfer
reduces to three mechanical transforms (cast `timestamptz` → naive UTC; cast Postgres ENUM → text; drop
graph-irrelevant columns) — which belong in the **views**, the single auditable boundary. Full record:
`plan/analysis/ladybug_translation_research/SYNTHESIS.md`.

**Consequences.**
- **Two correctness rules the projection MUST obey** (a naive `WHERE status='active'` projection is
  *wrong*): (1) **merge-redirect** — `entities.merged_into` is a redirect, not a rewrite, and relations
  are not re-pointed in PG, so endpoints must be recursively resolved to their surviving entity (cycle-safe;
  a pre-snapshot validation gate aborts on cycles/dangling endpoints) or every edge touching a merged
  entity is silently dropped; (2) **keep every retracted edge by default** for *transaction-time* as-of
  (not `invalidated_at IS NULL` and not an age filter), while **aligning node/edge retention** — an edge
  whose survivor-redirected endpoint was retired/forgotten (§13) is dropped because that endpoint cannot
  be an emitted node. Parallel edges (distinct `relation_id`) are preserved, never blind-`DISTINCT`-
  collapsed (same-(s,p,o) collapse is E3's job, D43). A finite hot-snapshot horizon requires a measured
  P2 design revision; it is not a Phase-0 literal, setting, migration input, or hidden default (D69).
- **`observations` and claims never project** (D43/D18): a value is not a node, and a LadybugDB REL
  endpoint must be a node table — the engine rule and the design rule are the same constraint.
- **As-of (refines D10).** LadybugDB has no native temporal semantics, **and you cannot `MATCH`-traverse a
  projected graph** — `PROJECT_GRAPH[_CYPHER]` feeds GDS algorithms only (it is `(STRING,STRING)`; there is
  no `MATCH … IN GRAPH`). As-of is therefore **inline path-predicate filtering** (`WHERE all(r IN rels(p)
  …)`) for correctness, or a **materialized persistent `CREATE GRAPH`/`USE GRAPH`** for heavy/repeat
  analytics. D10's "as-of via projected graphs" holds for *algorithms*, not path traversal — note added.
- **Transport.** `COPY <Node|Rel> FROM SQL_QUERY('pg', …)` is verified, but the **committed transport
  stays the Parquet hop (D7)** until cross-DB attach throughput at 10⁷–10⁸ rows is measured; both
  transports consume the same views. Graph-derived metrics (`pagerank`/`graph_degree`) are computed
  post-load (D11), never reprojected.
- **Spikes** (none blocking): UUID-PK smoke test on the deployed build; attach scan-pushdown/throughput;
  the merge-recursion cycle gate; inline multi-hop path-filter performance. Tracked in `questions.md`.

## D45. Plane K compilation is planned and manifest-driven — planner / writer / driver replace free agent sessions

**Decision.** The K plane is produced by a compile system with three roles: a **planner** (LLM)
that owns *structure* — which pages exist and each page's **routing rules**, recorded as
append-only `knowledge_plan_decisions`; **writers** (LLM — Codex/OpenCode, optionally full agent
sessions with retrieval tools) that own *content* — one writer per page per cycle, full creative
latitude; and a deterministic **driver** that computes staleness, schedules writers in dependency
order (a scope's shared model page first, children before parents, the root index last), validates
outputs, and is the repo's **only automated committer**. Routing rules are **mechanical** — a
closed kind set (`entity`, `entity_subtree`, `predicate_beat`, `community`, `doc_set`,
`scope_interests`, `manual`) evaluated by SQL over keys plane E already produces (canonical
entities, governed predicates, D11 communities, document metadata) via an inverted key index; an
LLM never decides routing at evidence-arrival time. **Citations are a binding writer output**
(recorded in `knowledge_artifact_evidence`, uncited candidates counted). **Staleness is
mechanical**: a page is stale iff its recorded `inputs_hash` (candidate evidence IDs + validity
fingerprints + curation + child summaries + prompt/model version) no longer matches — computed,
never guessed. In-session merge-conflict retry and the hot-file rolling-window worker are
**removed** (refines D12); the semantic linter is demoted from staleness detection to prose
quality assurance.

**Context.** The prior mechanism (concurrent sessions editing shared files) left the two
load-bearing steps — routing new evidence to pages (`knowledge_refresh_queue.artifact_id` NULL =
"decide which at processing time") and deciding which pages exist — as unrecorded, per-cycle LLM
improvisation, then added contention machinery to survive its consequences. It also made "is this
page stale?", "which pages does this deletion touch?", and "is coverage complete?" undecidable,
because the compile's read set was never recorded. Plane K was the only non-deterministic stage
whose decisions were not durable state — this applies D33's ledger discipline (extraction ledger,
adjudication transcripts, resolution decisions) to the last holdout. Routing rides on E-plane
labels, so it costs no new intelligence and zero LLM calls (the D9 rule, applied to the routing
path). **Accepts O4** (input manifests / semantic regenerability).

**Consequences.** Staleness, deletion reach, and incremental refresh become SQL ("recompile only
summaries whose referenced claims changed" is now exact); contention is structurally impossible
(disjoint writes + one committer); every compiled page carries freshness provenance (feeds the
mixed-freshness story); K cost scales with dirty pages; planner structure decisions are
reviewable, blast-radius-gated state (D24 pattern). New control-plane tables in
`postgres_schema_design.md` §11. Full design: `k_layers_design.md`.

## D46. Two page kinds — compiled vs authored; the ownership contract narrows K's precious surface to human-authored content

**Decision.** Every K artifact is one of two kinds. **Compiled** pages are evidence-derived:
machine-owned body, regenerated by their writer when stale. **Authored** pages are first-class
human/agent-authored content (target states, designs, decisions, position papers): **never
auto-regenerated**; when evidence they cite changes they receive a **review flag**, not a
rewrite. Both kinds carry citations; authored pages declare them (plus optional **watch rules**
— routing rules whose consequence is a flag) in frontmatter the driver syncs to Postgres. Human
input to compiled pages lives in a per-page **curation sidecar** (pins, exclusions, corrections,
guidance) — a first-class compile input whose enforceable subset is enforced mechanically. A
direct human edit to a compiled body is detected (`content_hash` mismatch) and **quarantined**
into a proposed sidecar entry — never silently overwritten, never silently absorbed.

**Context.** Two forces. (1) Not all knowledge is derivable from evidence: a to-be architecture
or a mapping decision *is not compiled from claims* — it is authored content that must still know
what evidence it stood on (the migration deployment's as-is/to-be case). (2) D1's "the git repo
is not reproducible" over-scoped the precious surface: compiled pages are semantically
regenerable from the spine + recorded inputs; only human words are irreducible.

**Consequences.** Backup criticality concentrates on authored pages + sidecars (refines D1). The
deletion cascade reaches K mechanically: compiled pages recompile without removed evidence,
authored pages flag for the author (the system never rewrites human words, even to forget); the
hard-forget residual is git *history* erasure, named in `k_layers_design.md` §10. Authored
decisions get automatic invalidation alerts when the ground under them moves — "contradictions
are surfaced, never silently resolved" extended to the knowledge plane.

## D47. One compilation mechanism, N scopes — K1 is the default scope, K3 is the belief tier (accepts O2)

> **Refined by D73.** D47's one-mechanism/many-scopes decision stands, but its shipped K3
> belief-tier configuration is withdrawn. The shipped layout is K1 plus K2 scopes; normative
> principles and stances are authored K2 content. The Decision/Context/Consequences below
> record D47 at adoption time; D73 is the current policy.

**Decision.** Plane K runs **one mechanism**; K1/K2/K3 survive as *content tiers*, not separate
machinery. **K1** = the default scope (entity pages, topic/community pages, source digests, the
root index). **K2** = additional purpose scopes — each a git subtree + registry rows (D16),
each with a **shared model page** (vocabulary + domain shape) that is a declared compile input of
every page in the scope (cross-page coherence). **K3** = the belief tier: compiled pages under
stricter configuration — rules select only settled evidence (`evidence_count ≥ N`, no live
`contradiction_group`; N is a placeholder to measure), updates are evidence-gated (never
timer-driven), and every belief cites supporting **and** contradicting evidence. The separate
`k3_beliefs_design.md` is folded into `k_layers_design.md`.

**Context.** Objection O2: by mechanism, K1/K2/K3 were one thing (compile evidence → git
markdown) wearing three names, and a layer must earn its existence with a distinct mechanism.
The belief tier's distinctness is *configuration* (evidence gating, mandatory dual-role
citations), not machinery — exactly O2's "curated view seeded from high-evidence,
zero-contradiction relations", now with a defined update rule. The "whose beliefs are these"
question stays open (`questions.md` #5) — the mechanism is agnostic to its answer; the answer
will configure it, not replace it.

**Consequences.** One pipeline to build and operate; "general" is just a scope; new scope = a
subtree + registry rows + rules (never new machinery). Dedicated K3 machinery would be justified
only by a use case the belief-tier configuration provably cannot express — a documented
alternative, not a plan. The tier layout itself is **configuration, not contract**: K1–K3 is the
shipped default; a deployment — including any user of the open-source library — may reshape,
rename, drop, or invent scopes and tiers freely. What is *not* configurable is the framework
contract: page kinds + ownership (D46), binding citations (D45), the single automated committer,
and the trigger surface's acyclicity ("knowledge structure is configuration, not machinery" —
the D15 principle one plane up; `k_layers_design.md` §2).

## D48. Projections propose, the spine disposes — hydration re-verifies against live Postgres

**Decision.** Every **query-engine result** (API / CLI / MCP) passes through **by-ID hydration
against live Postgres** before reaching a caller; the fast entry channels (P1 Lance, the P2
snapshot) only **nominate candidates**. Hydration re-reads validity windows, invalidation
state, and contradiction membership from the spine; candidates the spine no longer holds live
are dropped, and the drop count is reported in the response envelope. **Compound results
revalidate as units** (a graph path with one invalidated edge drops whole — never returned
with a hole, never silently re-routed). Two surfaces are explicitly *outside* the invariant:
**mounted reads** (snapshot reads by construction — covered by visible freshness metadata +
the skill's verify-on-spine motion, D51) and **K prose** (re-checking a page's cited IDs
detects staleness but cannot repair a stale synthesis — K answers are always compiled-grain
with freshness state, never live-confirmed belief).

**Context.** Every entry channel is a projection with lag (P1 write-behind, P2 an hours-old
snapshot per D7, K debounced). Without a single confirmation point, mixed freshness
(`questions.md` #23) forces every consumer to reason about three store ages — or worse, serves a
superseded fact as current (the zombie-fact class D3 exists to kill). With the rule, staleness
can only cost **recall** (bounded by projection cadence, reported per source), never
**correctness** (live, always). The rule also aligns with the physical topology for free:
entry/expansion run on local replicas (Lance datasets + the P2 snapshot on the API node's disk);
the one cross-cloud hop is the batched by-ID hydration that enforces the invariant.

**Consequences.** Mixed-freshness reasoning becomes data (per-source freshness stamps in the
envelope, D49) instead of consumer folklore. Projections stay dumb and rebuildable (D6/D7
untouched). The nominate-then-drop artifact is surfaced honestly. Hydration depth is progressive
(record → evidence → sources → bytes), so the confirmation hop doubles as the provenance walk.

## D49. The response envelope: grain type-discipline, inline contradictions, typed negatives, freshness stamps

**Decision.** Every retrieval response is an **envelope** carrying, besides results: the
**grain** (`fact` / `evidence` / `compiled` / `composite` — declared by every primitive and
recipe, enforced at composition: current-fact answers may be assembled only from
validity-filtered relations/observations; claims never answer "is it true now" — D41's bar made
mechanical; a `composite` answer is `parts[]`, each part strictly single-grain, so mixed
answers like S47's said-vs-believe pair never dilute the discipline); **contradiction
co-members never silently absent** (inline up to a guaranteed cap; beyond it the block always
carries `group_id` + returned/total + a continuation — one-sided answers are a **contract
violation**, not a ranking choice); **per-source freshness stamps** (PG live; P1 write lag; P2
snapshot timestamp; K `compiled_at` + staleness + open-flag count — the K block is the
reader-facing flag surface `k_layers_design.md` §11 spike 9 called for, and P3's `_index.md`
mirrors it for the browse path) **including each channel's `believed_at` horizon** (`null` means
that the channel is not age-bounded). Under D69 the hot P2 relation view has no retention-age
horizon: it keeps all invalidated relations whose survivor-redirected endpoints remain emitted
active nodes. A channel with a real age boundary still returns a typed `boundary` naming its
fallback rather than silently truncating history;
**explicit truncation markers** with continuations (no silent caps — hub answers are ranked
pages, never a quiet top-k, never a timeout); the applied temporal parameters echoed in
composition-ready form (`valid_at` / `believed_at` + the **identity regime** — resolution
follows *current* aliases/merge-redirects by default; pre-merge identity reconstruction is the
explicit transcript-based `identity_as_of` recipe over D21's `resolution_decisions` /
`merge_events`, and the envelope states which regime answered); and a **typed negative
taxonomy**: `unknown_entity` / `known_empty` / `boundary` (named limitation + workaround —
e.g. the D43 cross-entity numeric-scan boundary) / forgotten ≡ never-existed (not a kind —
indistinguishability is the requirement; as a CI gate it activates only when the end-to-end
deletion cascade, `questions.md` #24, is designed). There is deliberately no `denied` kind:
content-level authorization is out of library scope (D50 trust model).

**Context.** The callers are agents that must *reason about* answers, not just receive them; and
the requirements make three read-path properties non-negotiable: the claim/relation temporal
split explicit, contradictions surfaced never resolved, hard-forget indistinguishable from
absence. A taxonomy of "no" cannot be retrofitted onto a deployed API. Mixed-grain answers
("everything Alice *said* + what we *believe*", S47) stay honest only if the grain travels with
the data as a type, not a doc-comment.

**Consequences.** Contract tests become CI (grain truthfulness, co-member completeness,
truncation marking, forgotten≡never-existed). Agents plan against freshness and
flag counts instead of guessing. Envelope size on hub answers is a named spike.

**Refined by D65 (media).** The envelope's provenance block additionally carries **source
locators** (deep links to the exact page/region/time interval of the raw original) and the
**derivation disclosure** labels (`derivation_kind` + `evidence_mode`) for media-derived
evidence; a deployment without a configured media embedder reports the missing
`media_segments` search channel as the existing typed `boundary` negative — configuration
absence, never design absence. `plan/designs/media_design.md` §4/§5/§7.

## D50. Query capability = composable zero-LLM primitives; recipes are registry data

**Decision.** The query machine is **primitives + recipes + surfaces**. Primitives are typed,
orthogonal, side-effect-free, zero-LLM operations: `resolve` (the registry's non-LLM tiers
T0–T3 — exact, trigram, phonetic, embedding; no T4 adjudication on the hot path; ranked
candidates, never a silent guess; current identities with merge-redirects disclosed), `lookup`,
`search` (channel × target), `graph`,
`fuse` (RRF as an explicit operator), `rerank` (graph-distance / evidence-count / flagged
cross-encoder), `hydrate` (progressive depth), `transcript` (the audit trail as a query),
`delta`, `pages_about` (the K rule-key index read backwards — the reader's discovery index),
enumerated `aggregate` forms, and streaming `scan` (the batch surface, separate resource pool).
**Recipes are registry rows, not code** (the D5/D15/D45 move): declared compositions with
name / description / typed parameters / a typed primitive chain / **`output_grain`** and
**`answer_intent`** enums / version — so the linter enforces grain semantics **mechanically on
the enums** at registration (`answer_intent = current_facts` requires `output_grain = fact`
over validity-filtered belief primitives; prose-name checks are advisory only), the eval
harness measures recall@k per recipe, and **MCP tools render from the registry** the way
extraction prompts render from the ontology. Recipes add
convenience, never capability (testable: each recipe replays as its primitive chain and diffs
empty). **Non-goal:** any NL→query-plan compiler on the query path — the callers are agents;
the intelligence lives in the caller (D9 taken to its conclusion).

**Context.** The zero-LLM rule means the system cannot be smart at query time; it must be
composable, self-describing, and honest instead. Registry-declared recipes are how the
query-plan vocabulary evolves by governance rather than code accretion, and how three surfaces
(API/CLI/MCP) stay automatically consistent. `aggregate` is enumerated because an unbounded
ad-hoc GROUP BY over 10⁸ rows is a denial-of-service against the spine; `scan` is the escape
hatch.

**Consequences.** Adding a query pattern = inserting a registry row. Temporal composition needs
no machinery beyond D49's parameter echo. **Trust model — content-level authorization and
per-user scoping are library non-goals**: a deployment is one trust domain (every agent that
reaches it is trusted with all of it); isolation is achieved by **deployment separation** —
the deployment model's own mechanism (registries §1) — never by content filtering inside one
deployment (which would have to hold across every channel at once; mounts cannot
query-time-filter, so it degenerates to a deployment inside a deployment). Perimeter security
(who reaches the API/mounts) is deployment infrastructure. D16's filtered snapshots remain a
scope-view/performance tool, no longer carried as access control. (Refines D16's
access-isolation arm; `retrieval_design.md` §9.)

## D51. Consumption is filesystem-first for agent harnesses; four read-only mounts (raw included, off-path); a consumption skill ships with the system

**Decision.** The primary consumers are **agentic coding harnesses** (Claude Code, Codex,
OpenCode). Four surfaces mount read-only where the environment allows: **P3** (navigate first),
**E0 artifacts** (Markdown + structure + *derived* media — figures, thumbnails, transcripts),
**E0 raw originals** — mounted but **off the navigation path**: reached only via explicit
pointers from P3 stubs / `document.md` frontmatter, for whole-file media ingestion (video /
audio / photos — conversion is lossy exactly there), with **mandatory data-access audit
logging** and **mime-routed storage classes** (agent-readable media → standard/nearline;
audit-only originals → archive) — reversing D37's never-mounted arm while keeping its storage
split — and the **K repo** (read-only checkout). **Precedence rule:** full mount/API parity is
required (some environments cannot mount; API/CLI then carry everything, including byte fetches
by artifact handle); when mounts are available, agents are instructed to prefer the filesystem
for everything a filesystem can do (navigate, read, grep) and reserve API/CLI for what has no
filesystem equivalent (semantic search, graph traversal, as-of, hydration, transcripts, deltas).
The system ships a **consumption skill** — versioned with the system, partially rendered per
deployment (scopes, mounts, enabled recipes differ) — teaching a cold agent the planes, the
grains (and why `claims_as_of` never answers "is it true now"), contradiction and freshness
semantics, the mount layout, the precedence rule, and the orient(K) → verify(spine) →
audit(evidence) motion. Scenario **S58** — a never-seen harness using the memory correctly from
the skill alone — is the skill's acceptance test, run per revision.

**Context.** Harnesses are exceptionally good at filesystem work; mounted trees cost the serving
stack nothing and fit how harnesses already operate. The raw-mount reversal: the old rule's
audit property came from *logging*, not unmountedness (a gcsfuse read is a GCS read under Cloud
Audit Logs); its Markdown-first intent is a *navigation* property (promotion ≠ reachability);
its real cost was archive-class retrieval fees — solved by routing storage class per mime, not
by denying access. For whole-file media the original **is** the artifact: duplicating a 2 GB
video into the artifacts bucket would be pure waste, and a transcript is precisely the lossy
rendering a multimodal agent needs to bypass. The skill is the D15 registry-renders-the-prompt
move aimed at consumers: the system must be usable well with zero human explanation.

**Consequences.** `media/` in artifacts holds only *derived* media; whole-file originals serve
from the raw mount. E0 gains a storage-class routing spike. EXIF / embedded-metadata exposure
via raw is accepted under per-deployment IAM — the deployment is one trust domain (D50); data
with a different trust boundary belongs in a separate deployment, never behind an in-library
filter. The skill joins the eval surface (S58). Requirements §Retrieval is reframed around
harness-first consumption.

**Refined by D65 (media).** Confirmed and completed: raw pointers gain **typed source
locators** rendered as deep links (`original.mp3#t=873`) so the agent lands on the exact
moment/region, not a 90-minute file; unmounted parity requires a **locator-aware serving
operation** (a seekable, codec-aware segment — a naive byte-range is a false promise for
arbitrary video); the skill additionally teaches the three kinds of time and the derivation
disclosure labels. `plan/designs/media_design.md` §4/§8.

## D52. Execution classes are bound — no agent harness on volume or query paths; every LLM worker carries a ledger

**Decision.** Every worker in the system is one of three execution classes (inventory +
per-worker contracts: `plan/analysis/workers.md`): **deterministic** (pure computation; may
invoke non-generative inference such as embeddings or OCR), **programmatic LLM** (fixed-shape,
schema-constrained calls inside a cheap-first cascade — spend scales with ambiguity, never
volume, D4/D17), or **agent harness** (a Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode tool-loop session with
a declared write surface it may not exceed). Two bindings: (1) an agent harness may exist
**only on plane K and the review/audit seats** — never on a per-document, per-claim, or query
path (D9's zero-LLM query rule, generalized to the write side); (2) **any worker that gains an
LLM call gains an append-only transcript with it** — the D33 ledger discipline as a standing
rule for new workers, not a per-design choice.

**Context.** Compiling the worker inventory showed the discipline already holds everywhere
without being stated: the three load-bearing LLM workers (the extractor, the adjudicator pair,
the K writers) are exactly the three with transcript tables (`claim_extraction_decisions`,
`*_adjudications`, `knowledge_compilations`), and the harness surface is exactly plane K plus
review. A harness on a volume path would be unrecorded per-item improvisation at corpus scale —
the same failure D45 rejected for K routing — and cost/latency with no compensating judgment
gain.

**Consequences.** New workers classify before they are built; a proposed harness anywhere
outside plane K / review must argue against this decision, not drift in. The orchestration
design (`plan/designs/orchestration_design.md`) operationalizes the classes (queues, lanes,
budgets, DLQ); the schema's `pipeline_stage` / `pipeline_component` / `processing_target`
enums carry a value for every worker (schema §1).

## D53. Producer/checker separation across model families

**Decision.** Every **checking seat** — the sampled grounding judge (D32 layer 4), the
contradiction and citation-faithfulness evals (D22/O6, k_layers §7), the reviewer agent
consuming the D24 band and K plan-decision reviews, and the K reflection pass — runs on a
**different model family than the producer it checks**. With Codex/OpenCode fixed as plane K's
producer agents (requirements, D45), checker seats default to the **Claude family**; if a
producer changes family, its checkers move.

**Context.** Already stated for reflection in `k_layers_design.md` §7 ("a different
agent/model than the planner — fresh eyes"), assumed by D32's "self-grading is optimistic",
and implicit in D24's review-outside-the-proposing-context. Generalized here because the
failure mode is uniform: same-family checking correlates blind spots exactly where the design
depends on independence — a judge sharing the producer's family inherits the producer's biases
about what looks correct.

**Consequences.** Model assignments in `pipeline_component_versions` make the split auditable
(producer and checker versions name their models). Applies to every future eval/judge seat by
default; running a checker in the producer's family is a recorded exception, not a quiet
config choice.

## D54. Testimony currency + the counting rule — evidence_count ≡ distinct current-testimony lineages

> **Refined by D73.** The testimony-currency and counting contract stands. Only D54's former
> K3-eligibility consequence is removed because there is no shipped K3 tier.

**Decision.** Claims gain **testimony currency**: a claim is *current testimony* iff it belongs
to its document lineage's current extraction basis under the lineage's versioning mode
(re-extraction: the superseded generation's claims flip non-current, wholesale by coordinates —
no content matching; `living`-mode version supersession: claims whose chunks left the current
version flip non-current; `snapshot` mode: version succession flips nothing). Currency is
**bookkeeping, never validity**: an append-only, reason-coded transitions ledger (the D33
pattern; replayable, D7) plus a cached flag — no adjudication, no `invalidated_at`, claims
immutable in every D3 sense; transaction-time reconstructions still see old generations. The
cached counts are redefined once: **`evidence_count`/`contradict_count` (relations and
observations) ≡ distinct document lineages with current-testimony support, per stance** —
invariant under re-extraction, version churn, and within-document repetition; D42's
independence math gets its denominator (distinct *external* lineages). Zero-current-support
handling splits by cause: **source/curator-driven** loss (living-mode removal, deletion at
source or by operator) **closes** solely-supported facts per shape (states: `valid_until` cap;
measurements: `invalidated_at` — D43 no-cap), recorded as `retracted_source_removal` — no
flag; **processing-driven** loss (a new extractor generation fails to re-derive a claim from
an *unchanged* file) is mechanically undecidable (artifact-corrected vs extractor-regressed
demand opposite actions) and is **flagged `support_withdrawn`** for review — the flag's *only*
trigger; the flag rate per extractor version doubles as the rollout canary. Flagged facts
carry their state in the retrieval envelope. K stability: compiled-page `inputs_hash` keys on **fact state**, never raw
claim IDs; claim-grain citations key on `(lineage, chunk_content_hash)`; "a new claim row for
the same testimony" is not an evidence change (the stale-storm guard). Retrieval claim
primitives default to current testimony with an audit opt-in; P1's default channel indexes
current testimony only (re-extraction replaces the searchable claim; the audit channel sees all
generations).

**Context.** Review F3: evidence-once is keyed `(fact_id, claim_id)`, and a re-extraction mints
new claim IDs for the same sentences — every extractor generation doubled the headline
confidence signal (D9 reranking and adjudication weight), non-uniformly (only
re-extracted documents inflate), while duplicate generations polluted claim search. The
orchestration lanes (D52-era work) make re-extraction routine, so the leak was structural.
Both parallel analyses converged on the counting meaning ("current testimony from distinct
sources — never claim rows, extractor generations, source versions, or poll cycles"); the
divergent mechanism (a reified evidence-basis layer with a cross-generation assertion matcher)
was **rejected** — the matcher is the riskiest component in either proposal and every consumer
is servable from coordinates the pipeline already records; it remains the documented
documented alternative in exact-key mode only, adopted only on measured insufficiency (SYNTHESIS §2; design §9).

**Consequences.** Counts become comparable across facts again and mean what consumers always
assumed. Fail-safe direction preserved: withdrawn support flags, never silent vanishing (the
D25 lesson). Schema: a currency ledger + cached flag on claims; count-definition comments on
relations/observations; `support_withdrawn` review kind. Recount cost is bounded (a lineage's
evidence links) — hub-lineage cost is a spike.

**Refined by D65 (precision fix).** Three identities kept apart: the **source snapshot**
(`version_id`), the **representation** (`representation_id` — one conversion run's immutable
output; a version can own several generations, one current), and the **extraction basis** =
`(representation_id, blockizer_version, structurer_version, extractor_version)` — so "the
toolchain changed" and "the source changed" are formally distinct events, and the structurer
(already an extraction boundary in D56's `extraction_input_hash`) is named in the basis. This
matters most for media, where the common upgrade is the *converter* (a better ASR/VLM
re-reads unchanged bytes → a new representation object): such upgrades flow the
processing-driven ruleset exactly as an extractor bump does (currency swap; counts unmoved —
same lineage; `support_withdrawn` on non-rederivation; never retraction). The basis
coordinate is persisted on occurrence records and currency transitions.
`evidence_lifecycle_design.md` §1/§3; `plan/designs/media_design.md` §6.

## D55. Document lineages and immutable versions — connector-native identity; snapshot vs living semantics

**Decision.** The *logical document* is a **lineage** (stable `doc_id`) identified by
connector-native **`(source_kind, source_ref)`** (Drive file ID, message ID, watched URL;
renames/moves are metadata over a stable ref; a new ref is a new lineage). Lineages carry
append-only **version** rows (one per observed snapshot; conversion/structure provenance,
artifact URIs, `source_modified_at` → derived claims' `asserted_at`, D41) referencing
deduplicated **content objects** (bytes stored/converted once per `content_hash`, even across
lineages). Each lineage has a **`versioning_mode`**: **`snapshot`** (fail-safe default — every
version is independent dated testimony forever; right for versioned archival sources) or
**`living`** (the current version is the source's standing statement; superseded-version-only
claims lose currency per D54). **Absence is never *silent* retraction — in `living` mode,
removal retracts** (stress-test amendment O-B; the interim `removal_semantics: review`
softener was **removed** on user review — a documented alternative, not a dial): removal of a
fact's **sole current support** adjudicates the fact closed, **per shape** — relations and
effective-state observations get `valid_until` capped at the version's `source_modified_at`;
measurement/fixed-period observations get `invalidated_at` instead (capping valid-time would
violate D43's no-cap rule — the figure stays true *of its period*; what ends is our belief) —
both recorded as `retracted_source_removal`: loud, attributed, reversible; with other current
support, decrement only. Rationale: `living` *declares* the current version the source's
standing statement — serving a fact whose only support left that statement, while a review
queue waits, is the zombie-fact failure; wrong retracts are visible and self-healing. Every
source class the softener seemed to serve is served by the modes themselves (rolling logs are
misclassified snapshots; a messy living doc's sole-supported facts deserve to end); its re-add
condition — a measured source class with unacceptable false-retract rate that snapshot cannot
serve — is recorded in the design. The `support_withdrawn` review flag survives independently
as the *re-extraction* zero-support path (D54). Retraction checks evaluate **after the
connector's sync cycle completes**, so an intra-cycle section *move* resolves as a support
swap, never retract-then-reassert. **Deletion is uniform** (user decision): deleting a
document — one version, a lineage by operator, or **the file observed deleted at its source**
(treated as lineage deletion, stamped with the observing sync cycle) — removes its
contribution: claims retained as history with currency ended; solely-supported facts closed
per shape, recorded; no flag, no per-mode split. A source also always retracts by asserting a
retraction — itself a claim. Changed content is **new testimony** through ordinary E2→E3 (supersession
where it conflicts — D3/D4/D43 unchanged). Watched-source ingestion debounces (a stability
window coalesces rapid edits; unchanged revision/etag and unchanged bytes are no-ops).
Deletion gains a grain: delete a version (currency ends; lineage continues) / delete a lineage
(the existing cascade) / hard-forget (S55 semantics across versions). P3 paths and K
citations anchor on lineages (the F6 stability contract).

**Context.** The system had no model for a document that changes — the primary ingestion mode
for every target deployment (watched Drive folders, mail, URLs). Without lineage identity,
every edit is an unrelated document and the unchanged 95 % of its content double-counts —
versioning *is* the inflation problem at document grain. The E0 GCS layout
(`<doc_id>/<content_hash>/…`) always implied this design. The snapshot/living split is the
honest answer to "what does an edit *mean*": a property of the source, not of the system —
and the parallel analyses' one gap in each other (Codex missed `snapshot`; the internal
analysis initially had occurrences only implicitly) is reconciled in the SYNTHESIS.

**Consequences.** `documents` becomes the lineage table; new `document_versions` +
`content_objects` (schema §6); sections/chunks/claims hang off versions with the lineage
denormalized. Refines D37 (identity) and enriches D41 (per-version assertion times). Connector
identity rules per source kind are a named spike.

## D56. Content-addressed reuse — the cost of a new version is proportional to the edit

**Decision.** Extraction and embedding work is keyed by **content, not by document version**:
E2 idempotency keys on the **`extraction_input_hash`** — a fingerprint of **stable components
only**: the chunk's own block hashes + neighbor-chunk block hashes + stable header facts + the
extractor version + the structurer version (a stable config string — so a deliberate structurer
bump, which can reclassify section roles that Selection depends on, is a re-extraction boundary
by key construction; Codex review F10). **No LLM output participates in the key** (section path, summaries, and the
E1 prefix are excluded — non-deterministic across re-runs, they would make the key unmatchable:
the ~0%-reuse hazard; LLM-derived context is instead **carried forward** for unchanged regions,
D7 replay discipline — amendment A3). An unchanged chunk reuses its claims (re-attached to the
new version's chunk row); a chunk whose *neighbors* changed correctly re-extracts; embeddings
key on (chunk content hash, embedding version); conversion artifacts on (content object,
converter version). Reuse alignment is a **block-hash sequence diff** (A1) with
anchor-stabilized chunk boundaries (A2) — mechanics bound in `e1_chunks_design.md` §7. Reconciliation (D54) runs once per completed
basis change and emits **delta-only** K triggers. The efficiency ladder, cheapest exit first:
connector-metadata no-op → content-object no-op → conversion reuse → chunk-grain extraction
reuse → delta-only downstream. The claim-occurrence record is the **`chunk_claims` map**
(written on fresh extraction and on reuse — one immutable claim attaches to every
version-chunk that carried it; exact, never inferred from content-hash joins) — how
`claims_as_of` answers over living documents.

**Context.** An hourly watcher over an edited corpus must not pay per-version costs
proportional to document size (a 50-page doc with a two-paragraph edit re-extracts ~2 chunks,
carries ~148 forward). Extends D12/D25's content-hash idempotency one grain down — same
principle, finer key. The known boundary (chunk-boundary shift re-hashing unchanged text) is
bounded by section-aware chunking and measured by the reuse-rate spike; boundary-stabilized
chunk packing is bound in `e1_chunks_design.md` §4 (the spike measures its parameters, not whether it exists).

**Consequences.** Chunks gain content/input hashes; E2 workers check the reuse key before
calling the model; the E2/E3 cost model for watched sources scales with edit volume. Reuse
hit-rate and per-source conversion floors are spikes.

**Refined by D65 (representation-aware reuse).** "Conversion artifacts key on (content
object, converter version)" becomes an **identified immutable object**: the
`document_representations` row (representation-addressed artifact paths; a version's
`current_representation_id` swaps only on downstream completion — `media_design.md` §6).
Reuse gains the representation dimension (a chunk belongs to a representation's block grid;
an unchanged toolchain re-run replays the stored representation per D7), and the
`chunk_claims` occurrence map becomes the **occurrence-grain provenance home**: it carries
the resolved derivation labels + locator set for the claim occurrence (schema §7), because
those vary per representation generation even when the claim text does not (timestamps,
speaker labels, model family). D57–D58 formalize the chunking-strategy design discussion (July
> 2026), including the stress-test amendments A1–A3
> (`plan/analysis/evidence_lifecycle/stress_test_amendments.md`). Binding design:
> `plan/designs/e1_chunks_design.md`. Numbers are placeholders to be measured (CLAUDE.md).

## D57. The block substrate — a deterministic blockizer owns identity; sections snap to the block grid

**Decision.** Between conversion and everything else sits one deterministic layer: the
**blockizer** (ours, versioned `blockizer_version`) derives the document's **block sequence**
(paragraph-grain structural atoms: paragraphs, headings, list items, atomic tables, code
fences) from `document.md` via CommonMark-grammar segmentation + normalization, emitting
`blocks.json` (ordinal, type, char span into document.md, best-effort page/bbox provenance,
`block_hash`). **Converters do not produce blocks** (they are heterogeneous — Mistral OCR
exposes only per-page Markdown): the converter contract is `document.md` + a page map +
`media[]` (refines D38), and one shared blockizer runs downstream of every route — no
per-converter block semantics can drift. `document.md` stays clean Markdown — the immutable,
content-hash-addressed **coordinate system** that claims' spans, blocks, sections, and chunks
all reference by offset. Blocks are **not Postgres rows** (sidecar + derived keys only, the
D37 split). **PageIndex sections are persisted as block ranges**: a deterministic snap rule
normalizes the structurer's LLM-drawn spans onto the block grid (backward-snap, partition
enforcement, nesting validation, degrade-to-parent — a document never fails structuring).
Direction invariant: sections are *expressed in* block coordinates; **blocks are never derived
from sections** (LLM output must not touch the identity layer). Blocks alone carry identity
through edits (the D56 diff); sections carry meaning; both are views over one text.

**Context.** The chunking discussion's two corrections: (1) the idealized "converters emit
blocks" story fails against real tools (closed OCR outputs), so blocks must be derived by one
deterministic parser we own; (2) "chunks are whole blocks" ∧ "chunks never cross sections" is
satisfiable only if sections are unions of whole blocks — and LLM span output needs a
deterministic normalization target anyway (the system's standing propose/dispose pattern).
Block imperfection is tolerable by design: a mis-merged block costs diff *locality*, never
correctness — a far lower bar than sections, which is why blocks and not sections carry
identity.

**Consequences.** New E0 artifact (`blocks.json`) + `blockizer_version` on versions; grounding
gains one fixed coordinate system with tiered source provenance (exact into document.md;
page/bbox best-effort); a converter swap or blockizer bump is a document-wide reuse boundary
(route pinned per lineage). Design: `e1_chunks_design.md` §2–§3.

**Refined by D65 (media).** The best-effort provenance tier generalizes from `{page?, bbox?}`
to the typed **`SourceLocator` union** (page / image region / time range / video region —
version-pinned, precision-honest, integer milliseconds), fed by the converter's **source map**
(the page map generalized). Blocks from time-coded media carry time-range locators the same
way paper blocks carry pages. `e1_chunks_design.md` §2; `plan/designs/media_design.md` §4.

## D58. Chunks are non-overlapping runs of whole blocks; retrieval is multi-granularity by architecture

**Decision.** A chunk is an ordered run of **whole blocks within one section**, packed by
semchunk (the imposed constraint, kept as the packer) to a measured token budget, with
**anchor-stabilized boundaries** (packing restarts at content-defined anchor blocks, so an
early edit perturbs packing only to the next anchor — load-bearing for sectionless documents).
**No overlap, ever**: overlap double-extracts (duplicate claims within one generation — the
inflation D54 just killed), bloats P1 with near-duplicates, and its offset-arithmetic
boundaries destroy D56 reuse; the E2 bundle's ±N neighbors provide cross-boundary context
explicitly instead. Edge rules: an oversized *atomic* block (a table) becomes its own
oversized chunk; a pathological giant paragraph falls back to deterministic sentence-splitting.
`chunk_content_hash = hash(ordered block hashes)`; the reuse key adds `structurer_version`
(F10) and per-chunk commits under batching (F9). **Embedding granularity:** the dilution
problem is answered by architecture, not tiny chunks — **claims are the needle index** (P1
embeds every decontextualized claim; the ideal fine-grain unit by construction), **chunks are
the passage index** (sized for coherence; BM25 catches verbatim needles; RRF fuses), and
default search recipes **filter out `references`/`nav`/`boilerplate`/`legal` chunks by role**
(a Lance scalar — retrieval-side filtering of what was indexed; D25 untouched). **Extraction
batching** decouples cost from granularity: E2 batches a section's contiguous chunks per call
(bundle shared; claims still anchor per-chunk; idempotency keys stay per-chunk). The
**embedding-model choice (questions #3) is the design's one open branch point**: conventional
model → the E1 prefix stage exists (stored, carried forward); contextual model → the prefix
stage is deleted. Everything else is invariant across that branch.

**Context.** Chunks serve six masters (retrieval granularity, embedding quality, extraction
units, grounding, reuse stability, cost); the user's dilution objection is correct for
chunks-only systems and answered here by the claims channel — small-chunk/sliding-window
strategies approximate what decontextualized claims already are. Sliding windows are the worst
choice on every axis that matters to this system.

**Consequences.** semchunk honored as packer; token budget, anchor criterion, batch size,
blockizer fidelity, and reuse hit-rate are spikes (`e1_chunks_design.md` §10); P1 chunk rows
gain a role scalar; the E1 design no longer blocks on #3 — it branches on it.

## D59. Attributed stance is a keep class — stances become observations on their holder

**Decision.** E2 Selection's opinion-drop narrows to **unattributed** opinion. A stance
**attributed to a resolvable holder** — "X said / believes / prefers / opposes Y", including
the document author's own voice (the bundle header names the author, so an email's "I think we
should delay" attributes to its sender) — is a **verifiable proposition about X** (D32's
attribution rule already carries the epistemics: "*X said* Y" entails "X said Y", never "Y")
and is **kept**: extracted as an attributed claim, then normalized (E3) into an **observation
anchored on the holder** — statement e.g. "Bob opposes the pricing change" — untyped and
bi-temporal like every observation, on unchanged D43 machinery. A changed mind is **ordinary
supersession** (a stance is an effective state: the old stance's window caps at the new
stance's asserted time — "what did Bob think in March?" is an ordinary as-of query);
conflicting same-time reports of X's stance coexist via `contradiction_group`. **The guard:**
a stance claim never asserts its *content* as a world-fact — no relation or observation about
Y itself is ever derived from "X believes Y"; only the stance-about-X. Still dropped,
unchanged: holderless opinion, advice, hypotheticals, generic truisms (the rest of the D31
Selection list); a stance whose holder cannot be decontextualized to a resolvable entity
falls back to **drop** (the existing `opinion` ledger reason, which now means
*unattributed-only*).

**Context.** For the target deployments (assistant, agency brain, law engine), "what does X
think about Y, and did it change?" is core memory content, and the blanket opinion-drop
discarded it at extraction (F2). The keep/drop line is verifiability, exactly as D34 states —
what changed is recognizing that *attribution makes a stance verifiable*: you can check the
source and confirm X said it. Stances then get precisely the treatment they need for free:
they change over time, which is what bi-temporal observations with supersession were built
for. **Documented alternative (not built):** surfaced distributions — store every stance
assertion, never adjudicate a current stance, surface the spread ("3 for, 2 against, shifting
over June"); adopt only if group-stance distributions prove load-bearing, on measured demand.

**Consequences.** Scenario S37 ("who disagreed with the ESB decision?") unblocks: stance
observations, holder-anchored, semantically searchable, as-of-queryable. Selection's rubric
and golden set gain stance keep/drop coverage (extends D22/D35; **stance-holder resolution
quality is a spike** — "the team" must resolve to the right entity or the candidate drops).
Requirements §E2 updated; refines D31/D34 (the Selection lists), touches no schema DDL
(stance observations are ordinary `observations` rows; the drop ledger's `opinion` reason
narrows in meaning).

## D60. The library boundary — this repo is the complete single-deployment memory system; the human/operations layer is a separate product

**Decision.** The system ships as an **open-source library (Apache-2.0) with a commercial cloud
around it** — the Sentry-shaped split: fully self-deployable OSS, with the cloud absorbing the
infrastructure hardship and adding the human layer. This repo delivers the **complete memory system
for one deployment**: every stage that determines what the memory believes and whether it can be
trusted — E0–E3, the registries + resolution cascade (D17), supersession/contradiction (D3/D4/D43),
grounding (D32), the K compile machine (D45–D47), P1/P2/P3, the retrieval primitives/recipes/envelope
+ MCP server + CLI + mounts + consumption skill (D48–D51), the review CLI (D24), the eval harness +
canaries (D22/D35), cost metering with enforced budgets, DLQ, and the deletion cascade — plus a
runnable self-host stack (D61). Two **binding constraints on all future design work**:

1. **Correctness is never gated.** No mechanism that determines whether the memory can be trusted
   may live outside this repo or be conditional on a commercial offering.
2. **The cloud consumes this library unmodified**, through published extension points; no extension
   point may allow a consumer to bypass an invariant (ingestion always writes through E0; review
   always appends reversible D24-style verdicts; a control plane is never an authority for E/K/P
   truth).

Two **documented non-goals of the library** (scope boundaries, not phases): a **human web UI** — the
consumers are agent harnesses, and the agent surfaces (API / CLI / MCP / mounted filesystems) are the
complete consumption story (D48–D51; D24 already draws exactly this line for review tooling — CLI in
the library, web UI outside — generalized here to every surface); and a **multi-tenant control
plane** (orgs/users/SSO, billing, fleet management) — one deployment is one trust domain (D16, D50),
and operating *many* deployments is the cloud product's job.

**Context.** Written into the decision log — rather than left as business context — because this
boundary erodes *silently*: a design doc casually assumes a dashboard exists, or a
correctness-adjacent feature lands cloud-side under revenue pressure, and each step looks small. The
split principle in one line: **agents get the library; humans and operations get the cloud.** The
system's designed consumers are agent harnesses (requirements §Retrieval); a web UI appears nowhere
in the library's design, so the human layer is a genuinely separate product, not a carve-out that
weakens the OSS — which is also why the biggest commercial risk is *not* giving away too much but
shipping an OSS that nobody can run or trust (either kills the adoption the cloud depends on). The
supporting analysis lives in the (private) cloud repo; per Rule 1 the reasoning is carried inline
here so this entry stands alone.

**Consequences.** Future designs must not assume a web UI or shared tenancy. The retrieval API
carries a swappable perimeter-auth seam (API keys in the library; D50's trust model unchanged).
Watched-source/connector contracts (D54) write through E0, never around it. `README.md` carries the
outward promise (the "Open source and the cloud" section); `CLAUDE.md` Rule 3 carries the inward
enforcement; requirements name self-hostability explicitly. Governance instruments (CLA with a
relicense grant, trademark policy) are tracked in `questions.md` and must be settled before outside
contributions are accepted.

**Phase-7 scope reconciliation (2026-07-21).** "Complete memory system" means the OSS library
ships the mechanisms required for correctness, portability, and one-deployment self-hosting; it
does not absorb the hosted service's operating policy. The library therefore owns resumable
backfill/reprocessing, reproducible scale batteries, provider-neutral I/O batching, cost metering
and configurable budget parking, typed telemetry plus CLI inspection, the deletion contract and
adapter hooks, release artifacts, and export/import. Real corpus forecasts, monetary ceilings,
HA/failover topology, dashboard backends, backup schedules, fleet capacity, on-call runbooks, and
vendor-specific topology tuning belong to the deployment operator or `ultimate-memory-cloud` and
are not OSS implementation gates. Reference adapters remain in this repo; operating the reference
deployment does not. A hard-forget operation must purge every active library-controlled surface
and emit durable state that prevents a restore from resurrecting forgotten data; physically
expiring provider backups is the operator's implementation of that contract. This is an
application of D60's existing boundary, not a new subsystem or a retreat from correctness.

## D61. Provider ports — the deployment substrate is pluggable; the imposed constraints become the reference deployment

**Decision.** The deployment *substrate* is reached only through narrow **ports** (interfaces with
swappable implementations), each with exactly **two maintained adapters** — a **self-host adapter**
and the **reference adapter** (which is also what the cloud offering runs):

| Port | Self-host adapter | Reference adapter |
|---|---|---|
| Object store (raw, artifacts, snapshots) | S3-compatible (e.g. MinIO); local FS for dev | GCS |
| Task queue / scheduler (at-least-once announcement, scheduled delivery, rate limits) | Postgres-backed queue (`SKIP LOCKED`; application retry/DLQ state is the row, D12/D67) | Cloud Tasks + Cloud Run jobs |
| Mount publication (P3 + artifact/raw/K mounts, D51) | local directory trees | GCS + gcsfuse |
| K git remote | any git remote | hosted per-deployment repo |
| Model / embedding providers | BYO keys | configured providers |
| Telemetry export | OTLP / stdout | managed collection |
| Auth perimeter | API keys (the D50 trust model) | swappable middleware (SSO lives outside the library) |

**Anti-goal — the engine is not abstracted.** Postgres, LanceDB, LadybugDB, the E/K/P data model,
PageIndex/semchunk/Claimify, and the K compile machine are the system's *identity*, not substrate; no
port wraps them, and no design should hedge on them. The requirements' former "Imposed constraints"
section is re-titled the **reference deployment**: the fixed production profile (Postgres on Hetzner;
GCP Cloud Run jobs via Cloud Tasks; GCS + gcsfuse) — now *a profile of the ports* rather than an
assumption embedded in every design.

**Context.** As previously written, the requirements pinned the deployment substrate to one vendor's
cloud accounts — an "open-source library" a self-hosting user could not actually run (D60's
biggest-failure-mode). The port set is deliberately narrow — substrate only, two adapters each,
provider maximalism rejected — so the fix costs little: the queue port's self-host adapter is barely
new machinery (dead-letter state is already Postgres rows), mount publication already produces plain
generated files (D40), and the K driver already speaks ordinary git.

**Consequences.** Requirements §"Imposed constraints" reframed (fixed engine choices vs. ports vs.
reference profile). Designs that reference Cloud Tasks/GCS semantics mean the *port contract*
(at-least-once delivery, scheduling, rate limiting, immutable versioned paths, read-only mounts)
with the reference adapter as one implementation. A runnable self-host stack (docker-compose
profile) becomes definable — part of the D60 deliverable. The packaging/distribution design
(packages, deployment profiles, upgrade + migration policy) is a planned design doc, tracked in
`questions.md`.

**Refined by D62 (the queue row, strengthened).** The task queue port is **delivery-only**:
`processing_state` (D12) is the sole authority for what must run; both adapters merely *announce*
rows (self-host: `LISTEN/NOTIFY` + `SKIP LOCKED` claiming with transactional enqueue; reference:
Cloud Tasks push), and one **janitor sweep** re-announces lost deliveries on both — closing the
reference adapter's non-transactional-enqueue window with the same mechanism. A third
**test-tier** in-process adapter exists as test infrastructure, outside the two-maintained-adapter
discipline. `packaging_distribution_design.md` §3.

**Refined by D67 (queue state and vocabulary).** The port announces an existing
`processing_state` row by `processing_id`; route and `not_before` in a delivery envelope are
snapshots only. Postgres owns nullable lane, due time, defer reason, handler-attempt limit, and the
DLQ. The self-host initial wake is a schema-owned transactional `AFTER INSERT` notification, not a
port-side insert; explicit port announcements only wake existing rows. Cloud Tasks delivery
attempts and self-host wake-ups cannot consume an application attempt.

## D62. Delivery artifacts, delivery-only task execution, and the enforced code architecture

**Decision.** The library ships as **three artifacts**: the GitHub repo (source + the design
corpus), **one PyPI package positioned as the client** (base install = typed SDK + CLI + MCP
server; extras `[server]`, `[connectors-*]`, `[k]`; name decided 2026-07-13: dist
`remember-dev`, CLI `remember`, import `remember`, brand `remember.dev` — questions.md §11a;
the mechanical rename executes at the release gate), and
**container images on GHCR + a CI-tested docker-compose self-host profile** (Postgres + MinIO +
api + worker; the ten-minute quickstart is a release gate). The **client surface** is: query
(SDK/CLI/MCP), **lineage-aware ingest** (`source_kind/source_ref/source_modified_at/
versioning_mode` optional on push — external feeders get full D54–D56 lifecycle semantics;
writes always through E0), **connector management never execution** (connectors run
deployment-side — sync-cycle semantics must not depend on a client process), and the D24
review/admin CLI. **Task execution is one model with two delivery shells**: work is
`processing_state` rows (D12 — the sole authority); handlers are registered per stage,
idempotent, shell-agnostic; the self-host shell wakes on `LISTEN/NOTIFY` and claims with
`SKIP LOCKED` (enqueue transactional with the caller's state writes), the reference shell is
Cloud Tasks push; a **janitor sweep** re-announces lost deliveries on both. **The code
architecture is hexagonal with mechanically enforced arrows**: `model/core/spine/ports/
adapters/llm/workers/surfaces/eval/profiles`; core is pure and infra-free; SQL only in
`spine/`; vendor SDKs only in `adapters/`; **import-linter contracts fail CI on illegal
imports** (architecture erosion fails loudly); profiles are explicit composition roots — no DI
framework. **Export/import rides rebuild-first (D7)**: portable state = Postgres dump + raw/
artifacts buckets + the K repo; projections rebuild on import — the cloud↔self-host migration
path in both directions.

**Context.** Fills D60's deliverable and D61's profile mechanics. Redis/arq was considered for
the self-host queue and not chosen for maintenance: a second stateful service in every
deployment and the loss of transactional enqueue, bought for throughput this LLM-bound
pipeline never needs — the port contract still admits a community adapter. The delivery-only
framing dissolves the push-vs-pull asymmetry the two shells would otherwise leak into
application code.

**Consequences.** Roadmap §3 and Phases 0/5/7 updated (port interfaces + self-host adapters +
compose in Phase 0; PyPI packaging in Phase 5; release engineering + export/import drill in
Phase 7). The remaining stack-convention slots (package manager, lint, CI provider, secrets)
still gate WP-0.1. `questions.md` §11a's packaging item closes; the rename + CLA gates stay
open there.

**Refined by D67 (task execution only).** Both shells announce a `processing_id`; any route or
schedule values carried by the delivery provider are non-authoritative snapshots. The handler
re-reads Postgres, where lane, `not_before`, defer reason, application attempts, budget parking,
and dead-letter state have one normalized home. The self-host schema trigger couples initial row
creation and `NOTIFY` in one transaction; the delivery port never creates the row.

## D63. The embedding model is port configuration; default `qwen3-embedding-8b` via OpenRouter — the E1 branch resolves to conventional + prefix

**Decision.** The embedding model is **per-deployment provider-port configuration** (D61), never
architecture: every embedded artifact already carries an embedding version resolving to
`pipeline_component_versions` (model, dimension, params), and changing models is a
version-scoped re-embed batch (D7/D12), not a redesign. The **shipped default** is
**`qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b`** served through the OpenRouter adapter of the embedder port
(OpenAI-compatible embeddings API; $0.01/M input tokens, 32K context — a starting point to
re-verify at contract time), with **self-hosting the open weights (Apache-2.0) as the second
documented adapter** of the same port. This resolves the E1 branch point
(`e1_chunks_design.md` §5): the default is a **conventional** (non-contextual) embedder, so the
**context-prefix stage exists as designed**; the contextual mode (voyage-context-class / late
chunking) remains the fully designed alternate configuration a deployment may choose — the
choice is port config plus a re-embed migration, never new design work. The **stored dimension
is a measured knob, not a constant**: the model emits 4096-dim vectors with Matryoshka
truncation; the starting point is a truncated stored dimension (order 1024–2048) validated for
recall against the D22 golden set — 4096 is the ceiling, not the commitment (P1 index sizing
and the Lance cost math depend on this number; `lance_indexing_maintenance.md` §2).

**Context.** F8 named extraction-side spend and the embedding model as the dominant unmade cost
decisions, and questions #3 called the model "the single hardest thing to change later". The
default was chosen for three properties over benchmark deltas: **strongly multilingual**
(100+ languages — the inflected-language deployment path, registries §5, makes English-only
embedders a trap), **open weights** (self-hosting is a real second adapter, and the model
cannot be discontinued out from under the corpus — the discontinuation risk is what makes
"hardest to change" dangerous), and **hosted-cheap at one of the most-used embedding slots on
OpenRouter** (ecosystem liquidity: multiple providers serve it). "Hardest to change" is
thereby mitigated, not avoided — the migration path (version-filtered re-embed + P1 batch
rebuild) exists by design and is exercised by drills.

**Consequences.** The `context_prefix` worker's conditional existence resolves to *exists*
(workers inventory row 6; the per-chunk prefix call stays in the E1 cost model per F8's
three-calls-per-chunk math). E1 spike 8 narrows from "which model" to "which stored dimension +
prefix quality", measured on the golden set. P1 index/parameter choices unblock (dimension now
bounded). Questions #3 closes; review finding F8 closes. The embedder port gains its two named
adapters (OpenRouter-hosted; self-hosted weights).

## D64. Core predicates grow to 16 — `uses` and `reports_to` promoted from the watchlist

**Decision.** The D18 seed core gains two predicates, taking the core from 14 to **16**:
**`uses`** (Person | Organization → Product — adoption/consumption of a product/system/tool;
change-prone, ordinary supersession; deliberately distinct from `works_on`, which means
building/active engagement, not using) and **`reports_to`** (Person → Person — the
organizational reporting line; change-prone). Both move from the predicate watchlist
(registries §4) into the core table with these tight signatures; their formerly designated
pack homes (systems; work/HR) no longer apply to them. The watchlist keeps `owns`/
`acquired_by`, `lives_in`, and the guardrailed `enables`; the D5 `other:` promotion funnel
remains the default path for everything else — this is an owner promotion, not a change to
the funnel rule.

**Context.** The watchlist promotes on demonstrated `other:` volume, not intuition. These two
are promoted ahead of volume because every named deployment (registries §1) needs them
first-class from day one: "who uses which system/tool" is the backbone of the migration
deployment's as-is landscape and a bread-and-butter assistant/agency query ("person A uses
software X"), and `reports_to` is the org-chart backbone of people-centric retrieval. Both
carry exactly the properties that qualified the original fourteen: tight domain/range over
core types (the D18 gate bites), natural evidence aggregation (the same usage/reporting fact
recurs across sources), and clean supersession semantics (tool adoption and reporting lines
end and change — the bi-temporal model fits). Waiting for the funnel would have meant an
interim of `other:uses` / `other:reports_to` edges that bypass domain/range validation
(tier='other' is ungoverned until promotion) for facts already known to be wanted governed.

**Consequences.** Registries §4: the core table has 16 rows (`related_to` stays last as the
permissive parent); the watchlist shrinks to three entries. p2 §3's seed vocabulary updated;
extraction prompts pick both up by registry render (D15 — rows, not prompt engineering).
Core-tier obligations attach: D22 golden-set coverage for both, and the core stability
commitment (a future split pays the D15-flagged split cost). Signature notes: systems-pack
subtypes (`System`/`Module ⊂ Product`) inherit into `uses`'s range via D15 inheritance;
`reports_to` stays strictly person-to-person (a role-based reporting line is modeled through
the person holding the role).

## D65. Media is an E0 input modality — bound routes, typed source locators, derivation disclosure, and direct media search

**Decision.** Standalone images, audio, and video enter the system as **E0 inputs, never a new
plane or parallel pipeline**: a media file is a source whose testimony reaches the system
through a lossy, versioned transcription, with the original always one explicit pointer away.
Eight bindings. (1) **Canonical text lives in `document.md`** — all text eligible for
extraction, search, and grounding; a transcript existing only in a sidecar (`.vtt`/JSON) is
*interchange*, never canonical, and does not exist as testimony (fixes the
`e0_files_design.md` §2 transcript-placement ambiguity); `media/` holds only regenerable
derived assets (keyframes, crops, thumbnails, interchange transcripts), whole-file originals
stay on the raw mount (D51 unchanged). (2) The **D38 router gains three media routes**, each a
versioned converter: audio → **diarized ASR** (one block per speaker turn; speakers resolved
to entities only on positive evidence, else kept as stable anonymous labels — wrong
attribution corrupts stance memory (D59), missing attribution merely loses claims); video →
ASR + **adaptive keyframes** + optional VLM shot notes; standalone picture → **VLM
description** + OCR of visible text, behind a document-vs-picture discriminator (MIME cannot
tell a scanned page from a photo). Each route emits **sectioned Markdown** whose sections
carry their derivation kind structurally. (3) The **converter contract generalizes** (refines
D38/D57 again): `convert(bytes, mime, hints) → { document.md, source_map, derived_assets[],
manifest }` — the page map becomes a **source map** (character intervals → locators), and the
manifest is the route's complete self-account (component graph, execution context per D61,
output hashes, coverage policy + result, gaps/warnings, range→derivation labels). (4)
**Typed `SourceLocator` union** (`page | source_range | image_region | time | video_region` —
normative schema: `media_design.md` §4), pinned via its carrier to the document **version and
representation** (never a lineage or P3 path), precision-honest on every variant (never
fabricated by interpolation), integer milliseconds half-open on a declared timeline (never
frame numbers); grounding becomes **two hops**
(claim → `source_span`, exact — D32 unchanged; span → source map → raw locator, converter
precision) and D32's sampled audits become **modality-aware** (the auditor listens to the
interval / looks at the region — auditing only the derived Markdown would grade the converter
against its own output); deep links on every surface (P3 stubs, frontmatter, envelope
provenance handles, a locator-aware serving operation for unmounted parity — mounted, the
structured locator + local seek; the `#t=` fragment is display rendering, not a path). (5)
**Derivation disclosure**: converters label mode-homogeneous ranges with `derivation_kind` +
**`evidence_mode`** (`source_expression | model_observation | model_interpretation`; labeling
is total across all routes); claims **inherit both through their `source_span` →
labeled-range intersection** (a span crossing modes takes the most-mediated one) —
deterministic, cached on the claim's occurrence record (`chunk_claims`), no per-claim
judgment anywhere; the retrieval envelope surfaces them **per evidence item**; the mode is
disclosure, never a verdict (Selection's verifiability rules still govern keeps), and
distinct-lineage counts stay the only confidence input — correlation-aware adjustment is a
documented alternative, not in the system. (6) **Representations become identified immutable
objects**: a conversion run's output is a `representation_id`-keyed object
(`document_representations`), representation-addressed artifact paths
(`<doc_id>/<content_hash>/<representation_id>/…`), a `current_representation_id` pointer
swapped only on downstream completion — a re-conversion never overwrites the coordinate
system old claims resolve against; the **extraction basis** is `(representation_id,
blockizer_version, structurer_version, extractor_version)` (precision-fixes D54/D56): an
ASR/VLM upgrade is a processing-driven re-derivation (currency swap, counts unmoved,
`support_withdrawn` on non-rederivation — never retraction). (7) **P1 gains the
`media_segments` semantic target** — a logical target over per-modality cross-modal
subindexes (one row per image / keyframe / bounded audio segment; modality + embedding
family/version/dimension + representation + immutable locator per row; RRF-fused, zero LLM on
the query path, rebuildable); embedders are port configuration (D63), capability is
advertised **per query→target modality pair**, and any unconfigured pair answers as D49's
typed `boundary`. (8) **P3 shows media stubs + previews only** — stub frontmatter carries
`raw_uri` + duration + preview links; never whole raw media in the tree, never per-keyframe
pseudo-documents; raw stays off-path but fully reachable, mounted and unmounted (D51).

**Context.** The driving requirement: *the memory ingests the derived information; the
consuming agent keeps access to the raw files whenever it decides it needs them.* Both
analyses found the conceptual model already right (built in the D51 round) and the machinery
below it missing: no media routes at all in the router table; block provenance built for paper
(`{page?, bbox?}` — a claim from minute 14 of a recording could only point at the whole
file); model-mediated testimony auditable and correctable but invisible at read time; the
basis definition not naming the converter whose upgrade is the *common* media event. Direct
media search is designed in rather than deferred because **access is not discovery**: an agent
can open any file it has found, but it cannot decide to open a file it never retrieved, and
derivations are selective — the VLM never mentioned the small red connector, the transcript
says nothing about the alarm sound; under CLAUDE.md Rule 2 the earlier "documented boundary
with an admission condition" framing was deferral dressed as a boundary, and the mechanism is
cheap by design (one more Lance target riding existing port machinery).

**Consequences.** Design home: `plan/designs/media_design.md` (routes, locators, disclosure,
lifecycle, search, mounts, spikes). Cross-edits: `e0_files_design.md` §2–§3 (canonical-text
rule; generalized contract; routes), `e1_chunks_design.md` §2 (locator union replaces
`{page?, bbox?}`), `evidence_lifecycle_design.md` §1/§3 (basis), `e2_e3` §3.3
(modality-aware audits), `retrieval_design.md` §3/§5/§8 (media_segments target; envelope
locators + disclosure; skill teaches the three kinds of time — media-timeline `start_ms` ≠
world validity D41 ≠ transaction time). Scenarios: S59 strengthened (deep link to the exact
interval, mounted and unmounted); S62 (media-segment discovery), S63 (image-region grounding)
added. Counting is already safe: a caption and a transcript of one video are two views of
**one** lineage (D54); the envelope keeps derivation-family provenance visible (ten images
captioned by one VLM family share one systematic perception error — composes with D42).
Refines D38/D57 (contract, routes), D51 (completed with locator deep links), D32 (two-hop +
modality-aware audits), D54/D56 (representation objects + basis + occurrence provenance),
D49 (envelope + boundary); D8/D9/D63 unchanged.

## D66. The public documentation site — the WriteIt docs module in-repo, with a same-PR truthfulness contract

**Decision.** The project ships a **public documentation site** for humans (developers
evaluating, installing, operating the system) as a delivery artifact beside D62's three: a
self-contained static Next.js + MDX app at **`website/`** in this repository, exported to
plain HTML and served by **GitHub Pages at `ultimate-memory.writeit.ai`** (CNAME in the `writeit.ai`
zone; deploy via `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml` on pushes to main touching
`website/**`; PRs build as a check). The stack **replicates the proven WriteIt docs module**
(loopy-loop's documentation site, itself lifted from orchestra's — the pattern of Next.js's
own docs), inheriting its argued decisions and its adversarial-review fixes wholesale:
`@next/mdx` page-as-route authoring, Tailwind v4 + typography themed to the WriteIt palette
with an open font, `remark-gfm`/`rehype-slug`/`rehype-pretty-code`, **Pagefind + `cmdk`** ⌘K
search over the built HTML (self-hostable, no search service), a hand-maintained navigation
array, `output: 'export'`. Two standing rules keep it truthful through implementation:
(1) **same-PR docs** — any PR changing user-facing behavior (CLI, API/MCP, configuration,
mounts, connectors, deployment, the consumption skill) updates the affected `page.mdx` in
that PR, bound in `CLAUDE.md` and in the roadmap's WP execution rules; (2) **docs describe
what ships** — pages document behavior on `main`, never aspirations; the full-scope intent
stays in `plan/`; unshipped subsystems appear only on `/docs/project-status`; pages are
created when their subject ships (target IA in `website/README.md`), and empty placeholder
stubs are prohibited. Seeded now: Introduction, Concepts, Architecture, Project Status —
the material already true before features ship.

**Context.** The coding agents are about to build the system phase by phase; if docs are an
afterthought they will drift from day one — so the contract is installed *before* phase 1,
at the two places implementing agents already read (CLAUDE.md, roadmap §6). Replicating the
sibling module instead of redesigning: the decisions were already argued and reviewed for
loopy-loop (framework choice vs Fumadocs, GitHub Pages vs Firebase/Vercel, Pagefind vs
hosted search, palette/font substitution, accessibility fixes), and org-wide consistency of
the docs stack is itself worth more than any local optimization. The docs/skill split
mirrors the system's own epistemology: the *site* serves humans, the D51 *consumption skill*
serves agents against a running deployment — they must agree but never merge; and
plan-vs-docs is claims-vs-facts honesty applied to the project itself (the design states
intent; the docs state what is currently true of the artifact).

**Consequences.** Design home: `plan/designs/docs_site_design.md`; authoring conventions +
target IA: `website/README.md`; CLAUDE.md gains the docs section; roadmap §6 gains the
same-PR rule; eval check `delivery_docs_site` guards the contract. One-time ops step
recorded (Pages source + custom domain + DNS) — until bound, the site serves under
`writeitai.github.io/ultimate-memory/` where root-relative assets do not resolve.
Non-goals: versioned docs, docs SaaS/external search, server-rendered features;
API-reference pages render from the recipe registry when retrieval ships (D50) rather than
being hand-maintained.

## D67. Queue routing and retry state have one normalized home in Postgres

**Decision.** `processing_state` is the authoritative work ledger and also owns the fields that
govern delivery: `lane`, `not_before`, `defer_reason`, `attempts`, and `max_attempts`. A plane-E
row has `lane='steady'` or `lane='backfill'`; a K- or P-plane job has `lane IS NULL` because those
trigger models do not use lanes. The logical queue route is therefore
`(deployment_id, stage, lane)`, with `NULL` meaning the one unlaned route for that deployment and
stage. No physical queue name is persisted. Lane is routing and cost-attribution state, not part of
the D12 idempotency key: discovering the same `(deployment, target, stage, component_version)` in
both lanes cannot create two units of work. First insertion establishes the route; a duplicate
steady enqueue may promote a pending/failed backfill row so live work keeps its freshness
guarantee, while a backfill enqueue can never demote steady work. An explicit operator replay may
also reroute a dead letter. Historical cost rows keep the lane on which each billed call ran.

Promotion changes only backfill-specific waiting. A `budget`-parked row becomes steady/pending,
clears that defer reason, sets `not_before=now()`, and immediately faces the steady budget check;
if the steady budget is also exhausted it parks against that window. A caller-requested
`scheduled` wait and a failed row's `retry_backoff` are preserved exactly, including
`not_before`, attempts, and error, so promotion cannot bypass an intended schedule or a failure
backoff. The promoted row is then announced on its new route.

`not_before` is the one canonical name for the earliest instant at which work may be claimed;
`run_after` is retired as a synonym. `defer_reason` makes the reason queryable:
`scheduled` is caller-requested future delivery, `retry_backoff` is a failed application attempt
waiting for its backoff, and `budget` is healthy work parked until its budget window rolls.
Immediate work has no defer reason. Budget parking sets `status='pending'`, moves `not_before`,
and changes neither `attempts` nor `last_error`; it can never cause dead-lettering.

`attempts` counts application handler executions that actually began, not Cloud Tasks delivery
attempts or self-host wake-ups. `max_attempts` is the total execution limit; its starting value is
three, preserving D12's initial attempt plus at most two retries. A retryable handler failure with
attempts remaining sets `status='failed'`, records the full failure through the worker boundary,
and schedules `not_before` with `defer_reason='retry_backoff'`. A failure at the limit, or a
classified non-retryable failure, sets `status='dead_letter'`. The DLQ remains exactly those
Postgres rows; there is no adapter-owned DLQ.

Attempts are monotonic across manual replay so cost-ledger deduplication remains stable. Replaying
a dead letter sets it back to `pending` and raises `max_attempts` above the current `attempts` by
the operator-approved allowance; it does not reset `attempts` to zero.

Every `cost_ledger` row names its owning `processing_id`, the handler `attempt`, a
`provider_call_id`, and a deterministic `call_key` that identifies one logical call attribution
within that attempt (for example D31's `selection` and `decontextualize` calls). The
processing/attempt/call-key tuple is unique, so an acknowledged-late retry cannot double-bill while
one handler attempt may still make multiple calls. A batched provider call shares one
`provider_call_id` across the participating processing rows and allocates tokens/cost pro rata as
D31 requires; those slices must sum to the provider total and may not cross lanes. Nullable
diagnostic target fields are not part of deduplication. `cost_ledger.lane` records the
authoritative lane copied from the claimed `processing_state` row when the call begins. Budget
enforcement sums by
`(deployment_id, stage, lane, occurred_at-window)`; unlaned K/P costs use `lane IS NULL` rather
than inventing a third operational lane. A matching btree begins with
`(deployment_id, stage, lane, occurred_at)`. The self-host runnable index begins with
`(deployment_id, stage, lane, not_before)` over pending/failed rows, so workers can claim due work
with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` without inspecting `payload`.

The task-queue port and its adapters are **delivery-only**. They may announce a delivery envelope
for an already committed `processing_id` plus a snapshot of route and `not_before`, but never
insert the work row. The receiving worker must re-read and atomically claim Postgres. A stale
duplicate, an early delivery, a mismatched route snapshot, or a Cloud Tasks attempt header cannot
override the row or increment `attempts`. Self-host initial enqueue has no state/announcement
crash window because a Postgres `AFTER INSERT` trigger emits the `NOTIFY` transactionally; the
self-host adapter's explicit `announce` operation emits only a wake-up for an existing row
(retry, replay, janitor). Cloud Tasks creation remains post-commit and is repaired by the shared
janitor. Correctness-critical route, schedule, retry, budget, and DLQ state is never hidden in
`payload`.

**Context.** D61/D62 made adapters delivery-only, packaging required queue/lane plus scheduled
delivery, and orchestration required per-lane budgets with no-retry parking. The schema had none
of the normalized lane/due-time fields or indexes, leaving an implementer to put them in opaque
JSON, trust delivery-provider metadata, or fork semantics between self-host and GCP. This decision
makes the same state machine implementable by both shells and keeps D16 deployment isolation,
D12 idempotency, and D60's correctness-in-the-library boundary intact.

**Consequences.** `plan/designs/packaging_distribution_design.md` §3 uses `not_before` and an
announce-existing-row contract; `plan/designs/orchestration_design.md` §§2–4 and §6 use the same
state transitions; `plan/designs/postgres_schema_design.md` §§1–2 specify the enums, columns,
constraints, claim query, and indexes, and §16 maps this decision to both tables. D12 is refined
only in retry vocabulary (`attempts` is total handler starts; default three means two retries),
and D61/D62 are refined only by making delivery snapshots explicitly non-authoritative. No queue
Protocol, migration, adapter, or runtime implementation is created by this decision.

---

**Refined (2026-07-18) — batched-call attribution simplified.** A batched provider call is
billed as **one** `cost_ledger` row on the claiming processing row; `provider_call_id` and
pro-rata slicing are removed. A batch window is a section's contiguous chunks (D58), so it can
never cross a document or a lane — lane budgets and document-level accounting stay exact
without splitting, and nothing downstream consumed per-chunk cost. The
`(processing_id, attempt, call_key)` uniqueness and multi-call attempts are unchanged;
per-chunk cost splitting returns only via a measured need.

## D68. Each deployment has its own Postgres instance or schema

**Decision.** The physical tenancy realization is **schema-/database-per-deployment**. Each
deployed memory system operates in its own Postgres instance or isolated schema; one operational
database does not route rows for several deployments. The `deployment_id` column remains on every
deployment-scoped table and is constant within that database/schema. It is a stable identity and a
structural defense-in-depth key for composite uniqueness and foreign keys, not a cross-deployment
routing key.

**Context.** This makes the physical contract explicit and reconciles sources that already agree
on it. `registries_design.md` §1 says separate deployments have separate Postgres
instances/schemas, registries, and graphs. D16 says scope sharing occurs only within one deployment
and that separate deployments are fully independent instances. D50 makes a deployment one trust
domain and requires a separate deployment for a different trust boundary. The Postgres projection
contract (§10.A) already states that one graph snapshot is one deployment because Postgres is
separate per deployment, and the resolved tenancy entry in `questions.md` records the same answer.

The rejected alternative was one shared operational database with `deployment_id` as the leading
column in every blocking GIN index. Composite foreign keys can prevent accidental cross-deployment
references in that topology, but it conflicts with the independent-instance trust boundary and
adds a constant leading key to blocking indexes under the selected topology. Multi-deployment fleet
management belongs to the D60 cloud control plane; it is not a second tenancy model inside the
single-deployment library.

**Consequences.** `postgres_schema_design.md` §0 carries this as the sole operational contract.
The `deployments` table identifies the deployment served by its database/schema; after structural
Alembic head exists, D69's library-owned `bootstrap_deployment(...)` creates or verifies that one
row from typed profile inputs before it creates any deployment-scoped core registry row. Composite
deployment-scoped keys remain as defense in depth. The three blocking GIN indexes are
single-column (`ix_entities_name_trgm`, `ix_aliases_lemma_trgm`,
`ix_aliases_lemma_dm`), and `btree_gin` is not a required extension; `btree_gist` remains required
for the relations exclusion constraint. D23 records the exact index expressions and the reconciled
partition estate.

## D69. Unbounded graph-edge retention and post-head deployment bootstrap

**Decision.** This refinement closes three executable-contract gaps found while preparing the
WP-0.2 migration (`postgres_schema_design.md` former §10.A retention predicate and former §3 seed
ownership; `registries_design.md` former §4 `Document⊂CreativeWork` shorthand):

1. **The P2 relation projection is unbounded by age by default.** `v_graph_relates` emits every
   relation, whether live or invalidated, when both recursively survivor-redirected endpoints exist
   as emitted active entity nodes. Endpoint joins are the retention boundary. There is no
   invalidation-age `WHERE` clause, retention literal, setting, Alembic argument, or hidden input.
   A finite hot-snapshot horizon may replace this default only through a measured P2 design
   revision; the P2 spike measures whether one is needed rather than supplying a Phase-0 value.
2. **Alembic owns schema shape, not deployment data.** `upgrade head` creates structural objects
   only. The library operation
   `bootstrap_deployment(DeploymentBootstrapInput) -> DeploymentBootstrapResult` runs after head in
   one database transaction. It validates typed profile inputs; creates or verifies the single D68
   `deployments` row; creates or verifies the eight core entity-type roots; creates or verifies the
   sixteen core predicates; creates or verifies every concrete predicate signature; then commits.
   Any failure rolls back the whole operation. Its typed input/result and implementation belong to
   WP-0.3's library-owned tenancy/pipeline substrate, not to Alembic or a cloud control plane.
3. **The exact core is registry data, not shorthand.** `registries_design.md` §4 is the normative
   inline manifest. It fixes every required and behavior-bearing entity-type/predicate field and all
   116 concrete signatures. All eight entity types are roots. In particular,
   `Document.parent_type = NULL` and
   `Document.schema_org_ref = 'https://schema.org/CreativeWork'`; `CreativeWork` is the external
   schema.org anchor, not a ninth registry row. Extension-pack definitions and per-deployment pack
   activation remain separate from this universal core.

**Bootstrap identity, idempotency, and conflicts.** The idempotency key is the D68
`deployment_id`. Profile input maps directly to the documented deployment columns; database
defaults own status and timestamps. Each registry key is compared against the complete normative
manifest value: `(deployment_id, type)`, `(deployment_id, predicate)`, and
`(deployment_id, predicate, subject_type, object_type)`. The sole mutable-field rule is explicit:
`predicates.usage_count` is inserted as zero, but a retry verifies it is non-negative and preserves
its runtime-maintained value. A retry with the same complete definition succeeds without duplicates
or mutation. A conflicting deployment identity/profile value, core-row definition, extra/missing
core key, or signature set raises a typed bootstrap conflict and leaves no partial writes.

**Context.** The former view contained executable SQL
`interval '<retention>'`, but no binding source supplied a value. The former seed sentence assigned
deployment-scoped rows to a migration even though a fresh structural migration has none of D68's
truthful deployment UUID/slug/name/bucket inputs. The core list also used the same `⊂` glyph for
Document's external schema.org anchor and for extension rows' real intra-registry parent FKs. Two
independent PostgreSQL 16.14 reproductions confirmed the interval, NOT NULL, and FK failures. The
eight-root Document representation was separately proven executable.

**Rejected alternatives.** A magic or sentinel deployment, empty/placeholder buckets, nullable or
global core rows, a global seed template, a seed trigger, deployment data in migration history,
Alembic `-x` or environment side channels, and a newly invented Phase-0 retention setting/default
are rejected. They weaken D23/D68 constraints, hide correctness inputs, make migrations vary by
deployment data, or merely move the unresolved choice. A finite retention horizon remains a named
measured design alternative, not an unimplemented promise.

**Consequences.** D44/D49, schema §§0/2/3/10.A/16/17, registries §§1/4, P2 §8, retrieval §3,
questions 20a(e), and the Phase-0 WP-0.2/WP-0.3 boundary carry this contract. WP-0.2 remains
responsible for the complete structural migration and its PostgreSQL lifecycle proof. WP-0.3 owns
the typed bootstrap runtime and its transaction/idempotency/conflict tests. D15/D18/D23/D60/D64/D68,
the extension-pack model, indexes, and partition estate are otherwise unchanged.
This is a design/plan reconciliation only: it changes no shipped user-visible behavior or
configuration, so D66 requires no website or `/docs/project-status` edit and no aspirational public
documentation is added.

**Refined (2026-07-18) — the signature manifest is derived, not hand-listed.** The compact
domain/range unions plus the deterministic expansion rule (product of unions, subject-major;
same-kind diagonal for `part_of`; `any` = all eight roots in display order) are the normative
form of the 116-signature manifest, in both `registries_design.md` §4 and the packaged
`core_manifest`. The 116 concrete rows are always derived by that rule and count-asserted at
bootstrap and at import — the same 116 rows, one representation, no hand-maintained expansion
to drift from its source. Point 3's "normative inline manifest" is refined accordingly; nothing
else in D69 changes.

## D70. Per-stage model defaults are port configuration; the extraction default is `gpt-5.6-luna`

**Decision.** Per-stage LLM choices are per-deployment **model-provider port configuration**
(D61), never architecture — every stage's calls resolve through
`pipeline_component_versions` (model + prompt hash), so changing a model is a version bump
with version-scoped reprocessing (D7/D12), not a redesign. The **shipped extraction default
(E2 Claimify, both calls) is `gpt-5.6-luna`** (OpenRouter `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`; $1/$6 per 1M
at decision time — re-verify at contract time): the cheap end of the current smart tier,
strongly multilingual (the registries §5 inflected-language path), native structured output
for registry-constrained extraction, and prompt-cache pricing that lands exactly on E2's
shared per-document bundle. The same default serves the adjudication cascades' **small
rung**; the **frontier rung** defaults to `gpt-5.6-sol`. Checker seats stay cross-family per
D53 (grounding and eval judges default to a non-OpenAI family). K producer seats stay as
fixed by requirements (Codex/OpenCode) and are not this decision's subject.

**Context.** Phase 1's entry gate #4 needed the extractor pick. "Cheap yet smart, and
interchangeable — not set in stone" is the owner's requirement; the port + versioning
machinery is what makes interchangeable true, and the golden set (D22) measures the default
before any number locks.

**Consequences.** Phase 1's entry gates are both closed (#3 → D63, #4 → this decision for the
extractor seat; the phase-2/6 seats inherit the same principle and are gated by their own
phases' measurements). Gate register and questions #4 updated; a deployment overrides any
seat in its profile.

## D71. The structure route is a port-configured LLM seat; no PageIndex service dependency

**Decision.** The full D39 structure route runs entirely inside the library. The structurer
is an ordinary model-provider port seat (D61/D70): a prompt over `document.md` asking for the
PageIndex-style section tree (titles, roles, char spans, one-line summaries, nesting) plus
the placement hint, with the deterministic snap (e1 §3) normalizing whatever comes back onto
the block grid. **"PageIndex" names the output shape, not a dependency** — neither the hosted
PageIndex API nor a vendored self-hosted deployment of the tool is part of the system. The
seat defaults to the extraction tier (`openai/gpt-5.6-luna`) and is overridden per deployment
like every other seat (`UGM_STRUCTURER_*`).

**Context.** Gate #7 asked "hosted API or self-hosted?" — a cost/privacy/rebuild trade.
Examined against the machinery that had accumulated since the question was posed, both
options buy nothing: the snap already makes any LLM's proposal safe (a malformed tree
degrades to a coarser partition, never a failure), so the *only* thing the external tool
would contribute is the proposal itself — which any configured frontier/smart-tier model
produces from the same prompt. The hosted API would move document content outside the
deployment's configured providers (privacy regression, and a D60 boundary erosion); the
self-hosted deployment would add an operational dependency the deployment must run, version,
and secure, for no correctness gain.

**Consequences.** Gate #7 is closed. Privacy: documents reach only the deployment's own
model provider. Cost: the seat rides the same execution-class ladder as every stage (D52),
and short documents skip the call entirely (the synthetic root serves them). Rebuild: every
section row and `pageindex.json` sidecar carries `structurer_version`, so reprocessing is
version-scoped like any component bump (D7/D12). Degradation is total: no provider, a short
document, or a failed call all land the synthetic root — a document never fails structuring.

## D72. Community detection runs natively — Louvain ships on the deployed engine (refines D11)

**Decision.** Community detection runs **inside the graph engine** on the freshly built
snapshot: `LOUVAIN` over a projected graph, alongside `PAGE_RANK`, `K_CORE_DECOMPOSITION`,
and `WEAKLY_CONNECTED_COMPONENTS`. Assignments and centralities are still written back to
**Postgres** (D6: the graph stays a projection, and analytics are never reprojected into the
node tables). D11's external igraph/graspologic pass is **removed as machinery**, not
deferred — a simpler mechanism makes it unnecessary at any scale — and remains documented
here as the fallback shape if a future engine build drops the algorithm.

**Context.** D11 rested on a source-tree survey of the pre-fork engine
(`plan/analysis/ladybug_capabilities.md` §3: "No Louvain/Leiden"). Verified live against the
deployed build (`ladybug` 0.18.2) during WP-4.4 scoping: `LOUVAIN` is registered and is real
community detection, not a relabeled connected-components pass — on two 4-cliques joined by a
single bridge, WCC reports one component while Louvain correctly returns the two cliques
(asserted as a canary in the spike battery, so a future build that drops it fails loudly).
The `leiden | louvain` schema enum already anticipated both.

**Consequences.** No external analytics dependency, no second export consumer, and no
cross-process handoff for the community pass: the rebuild worker computes assignments on the
graph it just loaded and persists them **only once that snapshot publishes** — a snapshot that
fails validation or upload leaves no derived rows behind. The writeback lands in `communities`
(one row per detected community, membership carried by `entity_graph_metrics.community_id` —
there is no separate members table) and `entity_graph_metrics` (pagerank, degree, k-core,
community, component), and both are GC'd when their snapshot is superseded: they are
per-snapshot derived state, not history. Analytics measure CURRENT connectivity — the
projection retains invalidated and expired edges for transaction-time as-of (D69), and a
filtered projected graph keeps those withdrawn facts from inflating centrality or fusing
communities. The detector generation registers as a `community_detector`
`pipeline_component_versions` row (D12), so an algorithm or label-model change is traceable to
the assignments it produced. Community *labels* (the K1 navigation aid) remain a
batched micro-LLM call over each community's top members by PageRank, versioned under the
`community_detector` component (p2 §7). The general lesson is recorded with the engine
rulebooks: **vendored capability surveys go stale — verify on the deployed build**, which is
exactly what the WP-4.1 battery exists to do.

## D73. Core principles are authored K2 content; the shipped K3 belief tier is removed (refines D47)

**Decision.** Plane K ships with **K1 general knowledge plus any number of K2 purpose
scopes**. It does not ship a K3 belief tier. Personal or organizational core principles — for
example, "prefer simple codebases" — are normative commitments, not conclusions an evidence
threshold can discover. They live as **authored pages in a K2 purpose scope**, cite the
experiences and decisions they rest on, and use D45/D46/WP-6.6 watches, review flags, and
dispatch when that ground changes. Compiled K2 pages may summarize recurring evidence and
suggest a candidate principle, but only an accountable author may promote, rewrite, or retire
the principle. No numeric stance score is inferred.

The system's current evidence-qualified facts remain in E3 and are served through the D48–D51
retrieval contract. Compiled K1/K2 pages may synthesize those facts, but are freshness-stamped
prose, not a separate belief authority. D47's **one compilation mechanism, N scopes** remains
binding; only its K3 default is withdrawn. The already-migrated `knowledge_layer = 'K3'` enum
label remains an inert compatibility value: built-in configuration and behavior never create
or special-case it, and removing an unused PostgreSQL enum value does not justify a destructive
schema rewrite.

**Context.** Gate #5 exposed a category error in the old K3 proposal. "The evidence currently
supports X" is an epistemic summary; "I want my projects to favor X" is a chosen stance. The
first is already represented by E3 facts and ordinary compiled summaries. The motivating
personal-memory use case needs the second: a tiny, cross-project operating doctrine whose
words remain under the user's control while the system keeps it connected to changing project
evidence. K2 already supplies the scope, shared model page, compiled support material, authored
ownership, citations, watches, and notification flow. Selectivity and distillation do not earn
a new tier.

**Consequences.** Question #5 and WP-6.7 close by removal rather than implementation; Phase 6
ends at WP-6.6. There is no belief-threshold spike, belief-only scheduling exception,
machine-promotion path, or calibrated confidence score to build. Supporting/contradicting
citation roles remain useful generic provenance, but no special tier mandates both roles on
every page. A future concrete use case that cannot be expressed as a K2 scope must earn a new
decision; K3 is not a reserved roadmap promise. D45/D46, authored review flags, single-committer
compilation, and configurable scope layout are unchanged. This changes terminology and project
status documentation, but adds no new public runtime feature or configuration surface under
D66.
