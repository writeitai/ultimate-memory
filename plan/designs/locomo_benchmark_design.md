# LoCoMo full-system benchmark design

> **Status:** binding setup for WP-8.2. Implementation and synthetic tests are allowed; no real
> LoCoMo/API/provider run is authorized by this document.

## 1. Acceptance boundary

The adapter is repository tooling around the public `MemoryClient`. Before the owner walkthrough:

- exact dataset and manifests validate locally;
- the stock self-host profile composes all ten continuous handlers;
- P2/P3 can be built explicitly over the same stores the API reads;
- readiness is machine-verifiable through the public API;
- the answer agent uses only registry-rendered public recipes;
- all tool calls, envelopes, model usage, costs, and failures checkpoint;
- pure and synthetic tests pass; and
- no real benchmark or provider call occurs.

WP-8.2 remains in progress until an owner-authorized eight-question smoke finishes.

## 2. Fixed protocol

```text
protocol                RS-LoCoMo-Full-v1
dataset commit           3eb6f2c585f5e1699204e3c3bdf7adc5c28cb376
dataset SHA-256          79fa87e90f04081343b8c8debecb80a9a6842b76a7aa537dc9fdf651ea698ff4
categories               1, 2, 3, 4
answer-agent model       openai/gpt-4o-mini
answer temperature       0
max tool calls/question  8
max agent calls/question 9
judge model              openai/gpt-4o-mini
judge temperature        0
judge repetitions        1
primary metric           judge accuracy
secondary metric         official LoCoMo F1
diagnostic               coarse evidence-session recall
```

The tool catalog hash, prompt and schema hashes, adapter and repository revisions, manifests,
rendered documents, model identities, and component generations are stored. A change creates a
new protocol version.

## 3. Ingestion mapping

Each conversation runs in a clean isolated deployment. Each session is one immutable Markdown
document. Every turn is rendered:

```text
[D1:3 | 1:56 pm on 8 May, 2023] Caroline: ...
```

Image URLs are not fetched. Dataset captions and image queries are included only with explicit
derived-data labels. Session summaries and event summaries are never ingested.

```text
source_kind       locomo
source_ref        <dataset-commit>/<sample-id>/<session-id>
versioning_mode   snapshot
source_version_ref <dataset-commit>
```

The dataset has no timezone, so its literal timestamp stays in text and `source_modified_at` is
omitted.

## 4. Runtime composition

### Continuous services

`docker compose up` starts one process for each implemented steady route:

```text
convert
structure
chunk
embed_chunk
extract_claims
normalize_relations
adjudicate_supersession
embed_claim
reconcile
label_relation
```

All use the same deployment ID, PostgreSQL ledger, MinIO stores, OpenRouter adapter, and Lance
root. One route per process preserves the existing queue/rate-limit design; no workflow engine
is introduced.

### Aggregate projections

P2 and P3 rebuild after all selected session versions are E/P1-ready:

```bash
docker compose --profile operations run --rm projections
```

The one-shot service builds P2 into the snapshot bucket and P3 into the corpusfs bucket. It does
not run on every document and does not remain resident.

P3 publication is a deployment-integrity requirement in this protocol, not an answer channel.
The remote `MemoryClient` answer agent cannot browse a local P3 mount, and the ordinary recipe
registry has no filesystem operation. Results must not attribute answer quality to P3
navigation. A future mount-enabled LoCoMo harness is a separately named protocol.

### Plane K

The benchmark records that the stock profile has no K planner/writer runtime. `pages_about`
remains available and honest, but an empty result is not reported as K coverage. A later K-enabled
LoCoMo run needs explicit routing rules, repository/runtime fingerprints, K settlement in
readiness, and a new protocol name.

## 5. Lifecycle ordering and readiness

Normalization fans out as:

```text
normalize_relations
  ├── embed_claim
  └── adjudicate_supersession
        └── reconcile
              └── label_relation
```

This ensures labels enter P1 only after supersession and testimony reconciliation. A
no-claims document still creates the no-op terminal rows, so readiness has one deterministic
shape.

`POST /readiness?require_projections=true` receives a bounded JSON list of version IDs. The
response contains:

- every expected stage and exact component version;
- its status and completion time;
- P2/P3 version and publication time;
- a Boolean requiring every stage to be `succeeded`/`skipped`;
- a Boolean requiring both projection builds to begin after the latest requested terminal stage;
- every non-secret ingestion/query model binding.

The answer command refuses a false report and checkpoints a true one. The old
`--confirm-index-ready` flag is removed.

## 6. Public tool surface

The self-host setup seeds the normal canonical recipes plus P2 recipes. `resolve_entity` is
canonical because UUID-addressed fact tools otherwise cannot be used by a remote recipe-only
agent. P2 recipes are seeded only by profiles that compose `GraphQueries`.

The protocol hashes the exact descriptor list returned by `GET /recipes` and refuses a mismatch.
This prevents an added, removed, or changed tool from silently changing the benchmark.

No benchmark tool reads Postgres, Lance, MinIO, or internal handlers directly.

## 7. Answer loop

For each question:

1. Render the frozen answer-agent prompt with question, public tool descriptors, and prior trace.
2. Ask for strict `AnswerAgentStep`.
3. For `action="tool"`, validate the name against the catalog and call
   `MemoryClient.run_recipe()`.
4. Append arguments, latency, and the complete envelope.
5. For `action="answer"`, require at least one tool call and at most six words.
6. Stop at eight tools or nine model calls; exhaustion is a visible wrong, not a retry.
7. Checkpoint the terminal answer or failure.

The agent is instructed to orient, verify current facts, and audit evidence while respecting
grain, validity, freshness, truncation, typed negatives, and hydration drops. It receives no gold
answer, evidence IDs, summaries, or outside retrieval.

Evidence claims found anywhere in the trace are de-duplicated in first-seen order for the coarse
session diagnostic. This diagnostic remains separate from the primary score.

## 8. Commands

Local preparation:

```bash
uv run --extra benchmark python -m benchmarks.locomo prepare \
  --dataset /absolute/path/locomo10.json \
  --tier smoke \
  --output .benchmark-runs/locomo-smoke
```

Per isolated sample:

```bash
uv run --extra benchmark python -m benchmarks.locomo ingest \
  --run .benchmark-runs/locomo-smoke \
  --sample conv-26 \
  --max-documents 19 \
  --execute \
  --confirm-isolated-deployment conv-26

docker compose --profile operations run --rm projections

uv run --extra benchmark python -m benchmarks.locomo answer \
  --run .benchmark-runs/locomo-smoke \
  --sample conv-26 \
  --max-questions 8 \
  --max-agent-calls 72 \
  --max-evaluator-cost-usd 1.00 \
  --execute

uv run --extra benchmark python -m benchmarks.locomo judge \
  --run .benchmark-runs/locomo-smoke \
  --sample conv-26 \
  --max-judge-calls 8 \
  --max-evaluator-cost-usd 2.00 \
  --execute
```

The limits are run-absolute across resumed sample commands. The harness never creates or destroys
the deployment.

## 9. State and failure rules

`run.json`, manifests, and rendered document hashes are immutable. `state.json` is atomically
replaced after each ingestion, readiness checkpoint, answer, and judge.

Transport errors, invalid tool decisions, schema failures, provider accounting failures, step
exhaustion, and missing records remain explicit and score zero. Successfully parsed provider
usage is added to the shared answer/judge ledger. A call that crosses the CLI reported-spend
threshold is recorded as a failure and stops the run. Later unanswered items remain explicit
zero-scored missing records unless the operator resumes with an explicitly higher threshold.
Provider-side account limits remain the hard monetary boundary because a process can die after
billing but before checkpointing.

## 10. Pre-run checklist

- Clean git revision equals `run.json`.
- Local dataset hash and manifest validate.
- One fresh deployment is dedicated to exactly one conversation.
- Explicit ingestion model IDs are set; no rotating model router.
- All ten workers are running.
- Every prepared session has an ingest record.
- P2/P3 one-shot build completed.
- Public readiness is true; current serving-process model bindings are reviewed as
  configuration, not processing-time provenance.
- Public recipe catalog hash matches.
- Account/provider hard limits and the CLI reported-spend stop threshold are acceptable.
- No claim is made that K ran.
- Raw artifacts and failures will be retained for publication review.
