# Postgres Schema Design — the Plane-E Spine

This document specifies the **complete Postgres schema** for `ugm`: every table, column,
primary key, foreign key, index, enum, and the partitioning / deletion / versioning rules that
tie them together. Postgres is the **single source of truth for plane E** (evidence) and the
**only home of validity/invalidation state** (D6); every other store (LanceDB, LadybugDB, the
GCS corpus filesystem, the K-plane git repo) is either a rebuildable projection of what lives
here or an independently-backed source of truth whose *provenance and triggers* live here.

It is the binding companion to `overall_design.md` (§3 core data model, §9 lists this doc),
`registries_design.md` (D15–D24), `e0_files_design.md` (D36–D40),
`e2_e3_claims_relations_design.md` (D31–D35), `p2_graph_design.md` (D6–D11),
`concepts.md` (the claims/relations/evidence/bi-temporality explainer) and `decisions.md`
(D1–D69). Where a table or column exists *because of* a decision, the decision is cited inline.

> **Reading this as a stranger (CLAUDE.md Rule 1).** You do not need to have been in the design
> conversation. Each module opens with what it stores and *why it has the shape it has*; each
> column carries a description stating what it holds, its units, and any non-obvious constraint.
> Jargon is defined where first used or cited to a companion doc: **blocking** and **bi-temporal**
> in `concepts.md` §6/§5, **supersession** in `concepts.md` §4. The few statistical/tool terms
> this doc uses (**Wilson interval**, **Splink waterfall**, **novelty gate**) are glossed at first
> use below.

> **This is the full-scope schema (CLAUDE.md Rule 2).** It is sized and shaped for the millions-
> of-documents target, not an MVP. Numbers (partition cadence, retry budgets, golden-set sizes,
> threshold defaults) are **starting points to measure**, labelled as such — never committed
> constants. The one deliberately-excluded mechanism is the graph incremental-sync outbox
> (`graph_events`), a documented *non-goal* under D7 (rebuild-first); its absence is a scope
> boundary, not a deferral. §15 records it as a non-goal.

## 0. Conventions

These rules apply to every table unless a module overrides them with a stated reason.

- **Migrations & DDL ordering.** Structural schema shape is owned by **Alembic**
  (requirements_v3 §Code). The DDL in this document is the source; the migration emits each inline
  `--` column description as a
  `COMMENT ON COLUMN` and each `COMMENT ON TABLE` shown here. **All `CREATE TYPE` enum statements
  (§1) are created first, before any table** — they are presented in §1 (immediately below) for
  exactly this reason. Extensions (below) are created before that. Alembic creates no D68
  deployment identity row and no deployment-scoped registry data: after `upgrade head`, D69's
  library-owned typed bootstrap operation creates or verifies those rows (§2).
- **Identifiers.** All surrogate primary keys are **`uuid`**, generated as **UUIDv7**
  (time-ordered) by the application/worker, *not* the database — Cloud Run workers write
  concurrently and a central sequence would be a hotspot, while UUIDv7's leading timestamp gives
  index/heap locality on append-only tables and lets a reader derive the row's creation month from
  the id alone (used for partition pruning, §12). UUIDv7 also satisfies "`entity_id` is **never
  reused**" (D17/§4) for free. IDs are worker-minted so the row's identity is known before the
  INSERT (needed for idempotency and for deterministic-id dedup, §9).
- **Time vocabulary.** Every timestamp is **`timestamptz`** (UTC). Distinct *kinds* of time recur
  and must not be conflated (`concepts.md` §5):
  - **valid-time** — when a fact held *in the world*. On **relations** this is the revisable,
    adjudicated window `valid_from`/`valid_until`. On **claims** it is the **immutable,
    source-asserted** interval `claim_valid_from`/`claim_valid_until` (+ `claim_valid_precision`,
    `claim_valid_kind`) — *the window the source attributed to the proposition* (D41). Claim
    valid-time is *evidence* (immutable, many-valued per fact); relation valid-time is *current
    belief* (revisable, one per fact). They never write to each other.
  - **assertion-time** — `asserted_at` (claims only): when the **source** asserted the claim (≈
    the version's `source_modified_at`/`published_at`, D55). This is the assertion *event*, **not** the fact's world-time — "in
    2024 a report said FY2023 revenue was \$5M" has `asserted_at`=2024 but `claim_valid_*`=FY2023.
  - **transaction-time** — when the *system* learned/un-learned it: `ingested_at` (claims, relations)
    and `invalidated_at` (relations only). Never revised on claims; revisable on relations
    (supersession, D3).
  The relation pair (valid + transaction) = "bi-temporal". A relation answers "true in the world at
  T?" and "believed by us at T?"; a claim answers "asserted when / ingested when / asserted to hold
  over what world-interval?" — all three immutable.
- **Tenancy (`deployment_id`) and cross-deployment isolation (D68).** The system runs as **N
  independent deployments**, one per problem domain (personal assistant, agency, a manufacturer's
  migration, a legal engine), and each deployment has its own Postgres instance or isolated schema.
  There is no shared operational database that routes rows for several deployments; entity spaces
  are **never shared across deployments** (`registries_design.md` §1, D16, D50). Every
  deployment-scoped table still carries `deployment_id`, which is constant inside that
  database/schema. The column is retained as a stable deployment identity and structural defense in
  depth, not as a cross-deployment routing key. Every deployment-scoped parent table therefore
  carries a `UNIQUE (deployment_id, <pk>)` key, and every deployment-scoped foreign key is
  **composite** — `FOREIGN KEY (deployment_id, x_id) REFERENCES parent (deployment_id, x_id)` — so
  an accidental mismatched identifier remains unrepresentable even though UUIDs are globally
  unique. **The one documented exception is a
  *self-referential* FK** — a row pointing at another row of the *same* table (a section's parent
  section; a merge or adjudication supersession chain: `merge_events.reversed_by`,
  `relation_adjudications.superseded_by`). Both rows are by construction in the same deployment (same
  document, same registry), so these remain single-column for brevity; they cannot cross deployments
  because the worker only ever links rows it created within one deployment.
- **Foreign keys at scale (D23).** Nine large append-only E-plane tables are partitioned and use
  **logical foreign keys** — referential integrity is enforced by idempotent workers and verified
  by a periodic **auditor query**, not by a DB-level `FOREIGN KEY`. Seven use monthly RANGE
  partitions (`mentions`, `resolution_decisions`, `chunks`, `chunk_claims`, `claims`,
  `claim_extraction_decisions`, `testimony_currency_events`); two use static HASH partitions
  (`relation_evidence`, `observation_evidence`). Reasons: (1) Postgres requires a FK to a
  partitioned table to reference a unique constraint that includes the partition key, which would
  force that key into every child and join; (2) D23's "btree-only, cap write-amplification" mandate
  on these hot tables. **All non-partitioned tables use real composite FK constraints** with the
  `ON DELETE` behavior stated per column. A logical-only FK is tagged
  `-- LOGICAL FK → table(col)`. The auditor checks for orphans and any worker-owned logical
  uniqueness not enforced by a primary key; both evidence joins enforce evidence-once directly
  through their partition-compatible primary keys (§§9, 9.A).
- **Versioning (D1, D12).** Every non-deterministic output records the version of the component
  that produced it (`*_version` columns), resolving to a row in `pipeline_component_versions` (§2)
  that pins model + prompt hash + params. This is what makes "rebuild = replay stored state, never
  re-call the model" (D7/D33) auditable and what scopes a re-processing batch.
- **Enums** (§1) are small, stable, system-owned vocabularies; `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` extends
  them. User-governed vocabularies (entity types, predicates) are **registry tables** (§3), not
  enums (D5/D15) — they must be insertable at runtime with descriptions and parent links.
- **JSONB** is used only for open-ended, not-queried-by-key payloads (resolver feature vectors,
  tier configs, validation reports, DLQ payloads). Anything filtered or joined is a column.
- **Naming.** snake_case; tables plural; `_id` = identity reference; `_ref` = opaque key into
  another store (e.g. a Lance row key); `_uri` = GCS object URI; `_at` = timestamptz; `_version` =
  component version string.
- **No document/body text in Postgres (D37).** Postgres stores compact, query-critical metadata
  and the section index; bodies/Markdown/chunk text/embeddings live in GCS / Lance. The schema
  stores **offsets + URIs**, plus the small generated artifacts that must be *replayed* on rebuild
  (context prefixes, claim text, decision ledgers) — derived metadata, not source bodies.

Required Postgres extensions (created before all types and tables):

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;      -- gen_random_uuid fallback; digests
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;       -- T1 fuzzy blocking: trigram GIN on names (D17)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS fuzzystrmatch; -- T2 phonetic: daitch_mokotoff() (D17, NOT soundex)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS unaccent;      -- accent-fold names before trigram/phonetic (registries §5)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gist;    -- composite GiST: relations bi-temporal EXCLUDE constraint (§9)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_partman;    -- monthly RANGE partition automation (D23, §12)
```

PostgreSQL **16+** is assumed (composite-FK column-list `ON DELETE SET NULL` requires 15+; this is
relied on for `document_crossrefs`, §6).

System-owned, stable vocabularies, created before any table. Extended with
`ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`. (User-governed vocabularies — entity types, predicates — are registry
*tables*, §3, not enums.)

```

`novelty_gate` (in `adjudication_method`) is the deterministic short-circuit at the front of the
supersession cascade: if a new claim's `(subject, predicate, object)` fact already exists with a
compatible window and adds nothing new, adjudication is skipped entirely (no LLM call) — the
cheap-first rung of D4. The other methods are self-evident (exact / fuzzy / embedding / small
model / frontier LLM).

## 2. Tenancy & pipeline infrastructure

The substrate every other module sits on: the deployment registry, the component-version catalog
that gives every `*_version` string meaning, the idempotency/dead-letter ledger that makes workers
re-runnable (D12), D67's normalized queue route/due/retry state, and the cost ledger that meters
LLM/embedding spend per stage and lane (`overall_design.md` §8).

```sql
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

-- this Postgres instance/schema (D16/D68/registries §1).

### Post-head deployment bootstrap (D69)

The cold-start order is exact:

```text
fresh database -> Alembic upgrade head -> bootstrap_deployment(typed profile inputs)
               -> one deployments row -> 8 core roots -> 16 predicates -> 116 signatures -> commit
```

`bootstrap_deployment(DeploymentBootstrapInput) -> DeploymentBootstrapResult` is a library
operation owned by WP-0.3. It runs only after structural head exists and uses one database
transaction. The deployment row is the FK precondition for every registry row; all eight type rows
are the FK precondition for the concrete signatures; all sixteen predicate rows are their other FK
precondition. A failure at any step rolls back the deployment and every core row inserted by that
attempt.

`DeploymentBootstrapInput` maps profile-provided values to columns without hidden inputs:

| Typed input field | `deployments` column | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `deployment_id` | `deployment_id` | Required D68 stable identity and bootstrap idempotency key |
| `slug` | `slug` | Required, compared exactly on retry |
| `name` | `name` | Required, compared exactly on retry |
| `description` | `description` | Optional; `NULL` is a complete value and is compared exactly |
| `default_language` | `default_language` | Required typed profile value; no environment-only fallback |
| `raw_bucket` | `raw_bucket` | Required profile-owned URI/value |
| `artifacts_bucket` | `artifacts_bucket` | Required profile-owned URI/value |
| `corpusfs_bucket` | `corpusfs_bucket` | Required profile-owned URI/value |
| `knowledge_repo_uri` | `knowledge_repo_uri` | Optional; `NULL` is a complete value and is compared exactly |

`status`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` are omitted so the documented database defaults own them.
No magic UUID, empty bucket sentinel, nullable tenancy, global template row, trigger, migration
argument, or environment-only input participates.

`DeploymentBootstrapResult` is also fixed: it returns `deployment_id`, `deployment_created`
(whether this transaction inserted the deployment row), `entity_type_count = 8`,
`predicate_count = 16`, and `signature_count = 116`. Counts describe the verified complete core
after the operation, so a successful identical retry returns the same counts with
`deployment_created = false`; it never fabricates a success over partial state.

The operation uses compare-or-insert behavior, never a value-overwriting upsert:

| Row kind | Idempotency key | Identical retry | Conflict |
|---|---|---|---|
| deployment | `deployment_id` | Verify every mapped profile column; return existing row | Any mapped value differs, or `slug` belongs to another ID: typed deployment conflict |
| entity type | `(deployment_id, type)` | Verify every manifest field | Missing/extra core key or any field differs: typed manifest conflict |
| predicate | `(deployment_id, predicate)` | Verify every definition field; verify `usage_count >= 0` and preserve it | Missing/extra core key, invalid counter, or any definition field differs: typed manifest conflict |
| signature | `(deployment_id, predicate, subject_type, object_type)` | Verify the complete 116-row set | Missing/extra/different signature: typed manifest conflict |

On an empty deployment the operation inserts in the displayed order. On retry it verifies the
complete deployment/core state and performs no mutation. Detection of an extra row is limited to an
extra row claiming `tier='core'` for this deployment; extension rows and pack activation are separate
and do not conflict with the universal manifest. The exact entity-type, predicate, and signature
values are normative in `registries_design.md` §4. `usage_count = 0` is the exact insert value, but
the counter is runtime-maintained thereafter; retry never resets it.

## 3. Ontology & predicate registry (D5, D15, D18)

The **governed vocabulary**: entity types and predicates, their hierarchy (extend-never-fork), and
the **domain/range signatures** that mechanically reject extraction hallucinations
(`works_for: Person → Organization`). This is *content, not new machinery* (D15) — prompts render
from these rows. The core is identical in every deployment; **extension packs** and **scopes** add
to it per deployment.

## 4. Entity registry & resolution (D17–D24)

The identity authority. The **transcript/verdict** epistemics of D2/D3 apply (`entity_registry.md`
§4): **mentions are evidence** (immutable), **entities are verdicts** (re-adjudicable),
**resolution is replayable**. The governing asymmetry is **under-merging degrades gradually;
over-merging poisons catastrophically**, so everything is recall-conservative and reversible.
"Blocking" (cheaply narrowing the candidate-match set so you avoid an all-pairs comparison) is
defined in `concepts.md` §6.

## 5. Review queue, golden set & evaluation (D22, D24, O6)

Resolution quality is a *measured pipeline property*. Three first-class assets: the **cluster-
review queue** (D24 — review clusters, not pairs; route only the middle impact band to humans), the
**golden EVAL set** (D22 — unbiased, human-adjudicated, held separate from any future training
set), and the **eval-run history** (per-tier metrics with Wilson confidence intervals).

> **Wilson interval** (used below) = a small-sample-robust error bar on a proportion like precision
> or recall, so a P/R figure measured on only ~200 golden pairs is not read as more precise than
> the sample supports (D22). **Splink waterfall** (used in the review payload) = the per-feature
> score breakdown a reviewer sees — how each signal (trigram, phonetic, embedding, shared context)
> raised or lowered the match score — which is what a human needs to adjudicate a cluster.

## 6. E0 — document lineages, versions, sections, cross-references (D36–D40, D55)

Bodies live in GCS (raw + artifacts buckets); Postgres holds **identity, versions, processing
state, artifact URIs, hashes, costs, and the section index** (D37) — never the body. Each E0
sub-worker (ingest → convert → structure → crossref, D36) is **separately versioned** and
idempotent on `content_hash + its own version`.

**Three identities (D55).** A **content object** = immutable bytes (`content_hash` — the
idempotency/dedup key, stored and converted once even across lineages); a **document lineage**
(`doc_id`) = the logical document over time, identified by connector-native
`(source_kind, source_ref)` (a Drive file ID, a message ID — renames/moves are metadata over a
stable ref); a **document version** = one observed immutable snapshot of a lineage pointing at
one content object. Everything durable (P3 paths, K citations, crossrefs, GCS path prefixes)
anchors on the lineage; per-snapshot state lives on the version. Full design:
`evidence_lifecycle_design.md` §2.

## 8. E2 — claims, the extraction decision ledger, grounding audits (D31–D35)

A **claim** is an atomic, standalone, verifiable assertion (Claimify-staged extraction). Claims are
**immutable, append-only** — they record *what a source said* and are never superseded
(supersession is on *relations*, D3). The model stores both the standalone `claim_text` and the
verbatim `source_span` + offsets + the `added_context` substrings (D32), so grounding is
**provenance + entailment**, not verbatim-substring matching.

> **Reconciliation note (claim "type").** `requirements_v3` (an earlier conception) said claims are
> "typed (fact / opinion / prediction)". The current binding design (D31/D34/D59 Claimify Selection)
> **drops** *unattributed* opinions / advice / hypotheticals at Selection rather than storing them as
> typed claims — attributed stances are kept as ordinary claims (D59; `is_attributed` marks them) and
> normalize to holder-anchored observations — so the *stored* claim space stays "verifiable
> proposition", and dropped material lives only in the **drop ledger**
> (`claim_extraction_decisions`), not as a `claims.claim_type` value. We therefore carry no fact/opinion/prediction column; we carry
> `temporal_class` (the "temporally classified" half) and the grounding/recall-envelope fields the
> binding design names. Intentional simplification (CLAUDE.md), recorded so a reader does not think
> the column was forgotten.

## 9. E3 — relations, evidence, supersession adjudications (D2–D4, D8)

A **relation** is a distinct fact `(subject_entity, predicate, object_entity)` — its identity is the
*fact itself*. Relations are the unit of **supersession** and **contradiction** and carry the
**bi-temporal** windows. **Evidence** is the many-to-many join from relations back to the claims
that support or contradict them — where corpus redundancy collapses into `evidence_count` (a free
confidence/salience signal, D2). **One claim may yield several relations, and one relation may be
evidenced by many claims** (`concepts.md` §2): the same `claim_id` therefore legitimately appears in
several `relation_evidence` rows for *different* `relation_id`s; uniqueness is per `(relation_id,
claim_id)` only.

Objects are **always entities** (entity→entity). Attribute / single-entity / literal facts ("Acme's
headcount is 600") yield **no relation**; under **D43** they become **observations** (§9.A) — a
separate, untyped, entity-anchored layer with the same bi-temporal validity, so non-relational facts
get first-class temporal validity and supersession too. Time is bi-temporal edge metadata, **never** a
predicate or Date-entity (D18).

```sql
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- relations — distinct bi-temporal facts (D2/D3). The (entity_id,predicate) blocking key for
-- supersession is the composite index below; it is small (distinct facts, not assertions) —

-- exactly one authoritative home (D6) and cannot drift.
--
-- Uniqueness: a GiST EXCLUSION constraint forbids two BELIEVED, non-contradictory relations with
-- the same (s,p,o) AND OVERLAPPING valid-time windows. This is more correct than a partial unique
-- index: it permits re-occurring facts with non-overlapping windows (Alice worked at Acme twice)
-- and permits contradictions (carved out via contradiction_group), while forbidding duplicate
-- overlapping beliefs. Evidence-collapse (D2) finds the believed relation whose window covers the

## 9.A E3 — observations: non-graph facts with temporal validity (D43)

An **observation** is a believed fact about **one entity** whose object is a *value or statement*, not
another entity — "Acme's headcount is 600", "Acme's FY2023 revenue was \$5M". It is the non-graph
sibling of a relation: same bi-temporal windows, same evidence-collapse, but **anchored to a resolved
entity** and **not typed by any governed attribute vocabulary**. Design + worked examples:
`observations_design.md` (D43).

The contrast with `relations` is deliberate and is the whole point of D43:

- A relation's supersession slot is the exact `(subject, predicate, object)` key; an observation has **no
  typed slot** — the supersession blocking key is just the **resolved entity**, and the
  same-thing/supersede-vs-coexist decision is made by the **adjudicator** (entity-block → semantic-narrow
  → cheap-first cascade, D4), not by a schema constraint. So there is **no `value_domain`/`cardinality`
  registry and no typed EXCLUDE arm here** and **no DB-level uniqueness/overlap guard.**
- **"Never silently resolve" is a binding adjudicator contract, not a schema invariant — and the design
  is honest that this is policy, not a DDL guarantee.** The binding rules (verdict-critical, eval-gated):
  (a) a `supersede` (capping a prior `valid_until`) is allowed **only** on a *positively matched* prior
  with adjudicator margin above an explicit threshold, and **every** cap writes an
  `observation_adjudications` reason row; (b) below threshold, or on any incomplete comparison, the
  outcome **must** be `coexist`/`new`, never `supersede`; (c) conflicting values for the **same property
  and same period** (both matched *semantically* from `statement` — no typed column) always coexist
  under a shared `contradiction_group`. A contradiction precision/recall **eval gate**
  on the golden set is an acceptance criterion for shipping the adjudicator (the E2/E3 eval harness,
  `questions.md`). Net: a wrong call degrades to *coexist* (both surfaced) — never a silent overwrite.
- **Recall, precisely.** The entity block makes **all** of an entity's live observations *available*
  (exact key — no clustering can hide one). For a hub entity, semantic similarity only **orders** which
  to compare first; because `supersede` requires a *positive* match (above), a prior that top-k ranking
  skips results at worst in a **duplicate coexisting observation**, never a wrong supersede. So the only
  residual cost of imperfect narrowing is a redundant row to reconcile later — the safe direction.
- Observations **never project to the graph** (D18 — a value is not a node); they project to **P1/Lance**
  only (semantic search over `statement`/label, entity-anchored timelines).

## 10. Graph analytics writeback (D11) & projection snapshots (D7, D40)

P1/P2/P3 are **derived projections**; two things flow *back into* Postgres because the rest of the
system reads them: (1) **community detection + centrality** (D11 — Louvain/Leiden run externally;
PageRank/K-Core/WCC natively), serving K1 refresh triggers and salience priors; and (2) a
**snapshot registry** for P1/P2/P3 (D7/D40) — observability, validation gating, reader
coordination. Per-entity analytics are **regenerated each rebuild** and **garbage-collected** when
their snapshot is superseded — without GC these tables grow by ~entities-per-cycle forever at the
6-hourly cadence, which contradicts their disposable intent.

finalize step **deletes `communities` and `entity_graph_metrics` rows of superseded snapshots**
(keeping the latest, or latest-N for debugging) — the `ON DELETE CASCADE` from
`projection_snapshots` does this when a superseded snapshot row is pruned, or the finalize step
deletes them directly. The lightweight `projection_snapshots` registry rows and the GCS snapshot
objects are retained as point-in-time debugging artifacts independently of this per-entity GC.

## 10.A P2 projection views — the LadybugDB COPY contract (D7, D43, D44)

The P2 graph is a dumb projection (D6) rebuilt from Postgres (D7). To keep that projection **mechanical
and auditable**, the entire Postgres→LadybugDB boundary is a set of read-only **views** — one per graph
node/rel table — that pre-cast, pre-filter, survivor-redirect, and pre-aggregate, so the LadybugDB side is
a trivial `COPY <T> FROM SQL_QUERY('pg', 'SELECT * FROM v_graph_<t>')` (or the Parquet equivalent — same
views). Full analysis + LadybugDB-side DDL: `plan/analysis/ladybug_translation_research/SYNTHESIS.md`;
decision **D44**. The three transforms (timestamptz→naive-UTC, enum→text, drop graph-irrelevant columns)
and two correctness rules (merge-redirect, keep-retracted) live here, **not** in the graph worker.

The graph consumes a thin slice: `entities`→`Entity`, `documents`→`Document`, `relations`→`RELATES`,
`mentions⋈resolution_decisions`→`MENTIONED_IN`, `document_crossrefs`→`DOC_CROSSREF`,
`documents.document_entity_id`→`IS_DOCUMENT`. **Observations and claims never project** (D43/D18 — a value
is not a graph node). One snapshot = one deployment (D16: separate Postgres per deployment), so the views
take no `deployment_id` parameter.

```sql
-- Resolve every entity id to its final merge SURVIVOR. A merge is a REDIRECT, not a rewrite
-- (entities.merged_into; entity_id never reused) and relations are NOT re-pointed in PG — so endpoints
-- MUST be redirected here, or the rebuild silently drops every edge touching a merged entity. Cycle-safe

```

**Rebuild gate (D44).** Before the snapshot pointer-swap (D7), the worker asserts: (1) every retained edge
endpoint resolved to exactly one emitted survivor (no merge cycle, no dangling endpoint); (2) per-table
graph row-count vs. view row-count match. A failure **aborts** the snapshot rather than publishing a
corrupt graph. `COPY <Node|Rel> FROM SQL_QUERY('pg', …)` is verified; the committed transport stays the
**Parquet hop** (D7) until cross-DB attach throughput at 10⁷–10⁸ is measured — both transports consume
these same views.

rules + their inverted key index), what each page *rests on* (the citations), why structure
changed (the planner's append-only decisions), what each compile did (the compile transcript),
who else is *listening* (subscriptions, page watches, and the dispatch transcript — the trigger
surface, k_layers §5), and the debounced trigger queue (D12). Everything the driver computes —
staleness, deletion reach, orphan evidence, dispatch batches — is SQL over these tables; git
holds only content. Binding design: `k_layers_design.md`.

## 11.A Retrieval recipe registry (D50)

Recipes — named, versioned compositions of the zero-LLM query primitives — are **registry
rows, not code** (`retrieval_design.md` §4): the MCP tool list renders from this table, the
eval harness measures recall@k per recipe version, and the D41 bar ("claims never answer *is
it true now*") is enforced by a **mechanical constraint on the enums**, not by prose review.
Chain-level validation (a `current_facts` chain may compose only validity-filtered
relation/observation primitives) runs in the registration linter; the DB carries the enum
invariant.

```sql
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- retrieval_recipes — frozen query plans as registry data (D50). One row per recipe version;
-- surfaces (API/CLI/MCP) render from status='active' rows. The CHECK is the mechanical half
-- of the grain linter (D41/D49); the registration linter validates the chain itself.
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CREATE TABLE retrieval_recipes (
  recipe_id       uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  deployment_id   uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES deployments,
  name            text NOT NULL,               -- e.g. 'relation_hybrid_rrf', 'claims_as_of', 'identity_as_of'
  description     text NOT NULL,               -- rendered into the MCP tool description (D50)
  parameters      jsonb NOT NULL,              -- typed parameter schema (JSON-Schema form)
  chain           jsonb NOT NULL,              -- the typed primitive composition: ordered ops + fixed settings (channel sets, RRF constants, rerank weights)
  output_grain    recipe_output_grain NOT NULL, -- fact | evidence | compiled | composite (the D49 envelope grain)
  answer_intent   recipe_answer_intent NOT NULL, -- current_facts | assertion_history | orientation | audit | change_feed
  version         integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,  -- recall@k measured per (name, version) — regressions attributable (D22)
  status          ontology_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at      timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE (deployment_id, name, version),
  CHECK (answer_intent <> 'current_facts' OR output_grain = 'fact')  -- the D41 bar, mechanical
);
COMMENT ON TABLE retrieval_recipes IS
  'D50: recipes as registry rows. MCP tools render from here; the eval harness measures per (name, version); the CHECK enforces the D41 grain bar mechanically (current_facts ⇒ fact grain), with chain-level validation in the registration linter. Adding a query pattern = inserting a row.';
```

## 12. Partitioning & partition pruning (D23)

Exactly **nine** append-only E-plane tables are partitioned for scale. Seven use monthly RANGE
children managed by `pg_partman`; two evidence joins use 64 static HASH children created by the
schema migration. Monthly RANGE caps btree size, makes detaching an old hot month a partition
operation, and aligns with projection archival (p2 §8). HASH partitioning puts every evidence row
for one fact in one child and makes the evidence-once primary key enforceable. This estate is
binding. A load test (registries §11 spike 4, sized against ungated volume per D25) may justify a
documented revision to the monthly cadence or the measured HASH starting count of 64.

| Parent | Strategy and key | Primary key | Child management | FK policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mentions` | monthly RANGE (`created_at`) | (`mention_id`, `created_at`) | `pg_partman` | logical |
| `resolution_decisions` | monthly RANGE (`decided_at`) | (`decision_id`, `decided_at`) | `pg_partman` | logical |
| `chunks` | monthly RANGE (`created_at`) | (`chunk_id`, `created_at`) | `pg_partman` | logical |
| `chunk_claims` | monthly RANGE (`created_at`) | (`chunk_id`, `claim_id`, `created_at`) | `pg_partman` | logical |
| `claims` | monthly RANGE (`ingested_at`) | (`claim_id`, `ingested_at`) | `pg_partman` | logical |
| `claim_extraction_decisions` | monthly RANGE (`decided_at`) | (`decision_id`, `decided_at`) | `pg_partman` | logical |
| `testimony_currency_events` | monthly RANGE (`occurred_at`) | (`event_id`, `occurred_at`) | `pg_partman` | logical |
| `relation_evidence` | HASH (`relation_id`) | (`relation_id`, `claim_id`) | 64 static migration-created children | logical |
| `observation_evidence` | HASH (`observation_id`) | (`observation_id`, `claim_id`) | 64 static migration-created children | logical |

`pg_partman` creates and maintains only the seven monthly RANGE families. It does not manage either
HASH family; migrations create all remainders `0..63` before inserts can reach those parents.
`entities` and `aliases` are deliberately **not** partitioned (≤10⁷, the blocking targets whose
single-column GIN trigram/phonetic indexes span the deployment, D23/D68). `relations`,
`observations`, and their adjudication tables are not partitioned: distinct facts and their
decision transcripts are far smaller than assertion-grain evidence.

**Partition pruning on ID lookups.** Most hot queries select by id/parent (`doc_id → claims`,
`mention_id → resolution_decisions`, `relation_id → relation_evidence`), which do *not* mention the
partition key, so a naive query scans every monthly partition's local index. The mitigation, applied
by the data-access layer: **UUIDv7 ids embed their creation timestamp**, and a child row's creation
time is closely correlated with its parent's ingest time, so the application derives a time bound
from the id (or from the parent's `ingested_at`) and adds it as a predicate (e.g.
`AND ingested_at BETWEEN $lo AND $hi`), pruning to 1–2 partitions. This works for the
ingest-time-correlated RANGE families (`claims`, `mentions`, `chunks`, `chunk_claims`,
`claim_extraction_decisions`, `testimony_currency_events`, and — for the first-resolution pass —
`resolution_decisions`).

**`relation_evidence` is the exception, and is the reason it is hash-partitioned:** evidence for a
popular fact accrues over the fact's whole life, so an id-derived time bound would *not* prune a
`relation_id → evidence` lookup. Partitioning by `HASH(relation_id)` instead prunes relation
hydration to one partition *and* makes the real `PRIMARY KEY (relation_id, claim_id)` evidence-once
guarantee enforceable in-DB (a partitioned PK must include the partition key, which `relation_id` now
is). This is the D23 contract. The `claim_id` reverse lookup still fans across hash partitions, but
it is the cold path. `observation_evidence` applies the same policy to `observation_id`.

**Partition-key consequences in the DDL:** a partitioned table's PRIMARY KEY/UNIQUE must include the
partition key, so all seven RANGE parents include their time key and the two HASH parents include
their fact identifier. The application treats each UUIDv7 alone as row identity (globally unique by
construction); the wider RANGE keys are the Postgres mechanical requirement. The evidence joins'
pair keys are also the intended evidence-once identity.

## 13. Deletion / forget cascade (D37, requirements_v3)

Removing an input propagates through every derived layer, and **hard delete** of the original bytes
must be supported (GDPR forget, D37). Deletion is executed by a **deletion worker in batches**
(the large tables are partitioned and logical-FK, so there is no single giant `ON DELETE CASCADE`
transaction); the real composite FKs on the smaller tables are the integrity backstop. Two modes:

### 13.1 Normal delete (remove a document; retain audit history)

1. **K tombstone first.** Before touching evidence, enqueue a `knowledge_refresh_queue` row with
   `trigger='tombstone'` carrying the doc/claim ids (found via `knowledge_artifact_evidence`), so
   the K driver recompiles affected **compiled** pages without the removed evidence and raises
   `authored_review` flags on **authored** pages that cited it (D45/D46; the tombstone signal,
   D37). Doing this first ensures the links are still present to discover.
2. **GCS**: purge the document's raw + artifacts objects.
3. **`documents` + `document_versions`** (D55 grains): deleting the **lineage** soft-tombstones
   it (`deleted_at`) and every version (`status='deleted'`, artifact URIs nulled, `deleted_at`);
   deleting **one version** tombstones only that version row (its claims' currency ends,
   `version_deleted` — the lineage continues) and purges its content object if no live version
   references it. Rows are **kept** (the `deleted` enum value and `ix_documents_live` stay
   meaningful, the logical-FK auditor distinguishes "forgotten" from "never existed", and
   crossref targets resolve sanely). The worker then clears the affected `document_sections`
   (cascade) and sets dependent `document_crossrefs.to_doc_id = NULL, resolved = false` while
   **retaining `raw_citation`** so the link can be re-resolved if the target is re-ingested.
4. **`chunks`** (logical FK): rows are **retained** (they are the occurrence record, D56/F4) but
   their Lance vectors drop on the next P1 maintenance/rebuild (the deleted lineage/version is
   filtered from every index). The auditor ignores rows for documents with `deleted_at` set.
5. **`claims` are NOT deleted on a normal delete** (Codex review F12 — this is the fix that keeps
   "normal delete retains audit history" true): normal deletion **ends the claims' testimony
   currency** (`version_deleted` events; `is_current_testimony=false`) so they stop counting,
   stop surfacing in default search, and stop supporting current belief — while the assertion
   history (`claims_as_of`, audit opt-ins, adjudication transcripts) survives. Only **hard
   forget** (§13.2) scrubs claim texts/spans and the dependent `mentions`,
   `claim_extraction_decisions`, and `grounding_audits` content — S55's forgotten≡never-existed
   applies to hard forget alone. `relation_evidence`/`observation_evidence` rows are likewise
   retained as historical links (their claims are non-current, so counts exclude them).
6. **`relations`**: **not** deleted with one document's claims — a relation is a *shared* fact. The
   worker recomputes `evidence_count`/`contradict_count` (the D54 rule: `COUNT(DISTINCT doc_id)` over
   evidence rows whose claims are current testimony, per stance — the write-once `doc_id` on evidence
   rows makes this a single-table scan per fact; so duplicates
   cannot inflate it). A relation whose **current** support drops to zero via deletion is
   **closed** per the D54 source-acted rule (states: `valid_until` cap; measurements:
   `invalidated_at`; recorded `retracted_source_removal` adjudication — the `support_withdrawn`
   flag is exclusively the re-extraction path, never deletion). Where closure sets
   `invalidated_at`, the generated `status` becomes `invalidated` and the projection stops
   emitting it — it is **not physically deleted**, because `relation_adjudications` and
   `knowledge_artifact_evidence` reference it and the audit trail is retained. A
   `relation_adjudications` row records the retirement reason so it is distinguishable from a
   supersession in audit.
7. **`entities`**: not deleted; a separate GC **retires** (`status='retired'`) entities with zero
   surviving mentions. They are **not physically deleted**, because `merge_events`,
   `resolution_exclusions`, `relation_adjudications`, and `entity_graph_metrics` reference them and
   D21 mandates retaining merge history for un-merge. Retired entities are not emitted on rebuild.
8. **P1/P2/P3**: cascade "for free" — projections don't materialize removed/retired data on the next
   rebuild (D40).

### 13.2 Hard forget (GDPR — erase the bytes *and* the derived text)

Normal delete already purges the GCS bytes and the document row's text-bearing URIs. A full forget
additionally **scrubs or deletes the source-bearing payloads** that normal delete retains for audit:
`relation_adjudications.features`, `merge_events.evidence`, `mentions.context`/`surface_form`, and
any `claim_text`/`source_span` already removed with the claims. Because those audit rows reference
`relations`/`entities` via real composite FKs, a forget that *physically* deletes a relation/entity
must first delete or anonymize the referencing audit rows (or rely on the retire-don't-delete model
of §13.1 and scrub the free-text fields in place). The worker performs this as an explicit forget
pass, distinct from normal delete, and records it in `processing_state` (`stage`-scoped) for audit
of the erasure itself.

The logical-FK **auditor** (run periodically) catches orphans and worker-owned logical-uniqueness
violations, and ignores rows belonging to documents with `deleted_at` set (a delete in flight).
The evidence joins' pair primary keys enforce evidence-once directly, so the auditor does not
duplicate that check.

## 14. How a write flows through the schema (worked example)

From `concepts.md`'s running example — *Doc C (Jan 2026): "Alice Novak left Acme to found Beacon
Labs."*

1. **E0** `documents` row (`ingesting`→`ready`), `document_sections` rows; `processing_state` tracks
   each sub-worker; `cost_ledger` logs the OCR/structure calls (idempotent per
   `(processing_id, attempt, call_key)`).
2. **E1** `chunks` rows with offsets + `context_prefix`; vectors land in Lance keyed by `chunk_id`.
3. **E2 Selection** keeps the two verifiable propositions (any drop/edit → `claim_extraction_decisions`).
   Kept propositions → `claims` (`c3`, `c4`) with `source_span`, offsets, `added_context`,
   `anchor_ok`/`window_membership_ok` true (the CHECK); mentions of "Alice Novak", "Acme", "Beacon
   Labs" → `mentions` with `canonical_name_form`.
4. **Resolution** (T0–T4) writes `resolution_decisions` (method ∈ {T0,T3,T4_*,human}) linking each
   mention to an `entities` row via the `aliases` blocking indexes; "Beacon Labs" is new
   (`is_new_entity`).
5. **E3 normalize**: `c4` → `(alice, founded, beacon_labs)` — new `relations` row (passes
   domain/range via the normalizer's parent-walk), one `relation_evidence(supports)` row keyed
   `(relation_id, claim_id)` (a re-link is an `ON CONFLICT` no-op). `c3` triggers **supersession** on `(alice, works_for, acme)`: the
   blocking index `ix_relations_block_subj` finds it, the cascade adjudicates `supersede`, a
   `relation_adjudications` row records why, and the relation's `valid_until`/`invalidated_at` close
   (the GiST EXCLUDE permits this — the closed window no longer overlaps a live one; `c1`,`c2` claims
   untouched, D3). `status` flips to `invalidated` automatically (generated column).
6. **Projections**: next P2 rebuild re-points edges; `entity_graph_metrics`/`communities` write back
   (old snapshot's rows GC'd); `projection_snapshots` records the new version and flips `is_latest`
   after validation. `knowledge_refresh_queue` gets an `evidence_changed` event with the changed
   relation/claim IDs; the K driver routes it (rule keys + citation reverse lookup, D45) — Alice's
   and Acme's compiled pages go stale, and any authored page citing the employment fact gets an
   `authored_review` flag (D46).

---

## 15. Non-goals (scope boundaries, not deferrals)

- **No `graph_events` outbox / incremental-sync state.** P2 is rebuild-first (D7); incremental is a
  *documented alternative* (`p2_graph_design.md` §5), not built.
- **No value/salience-gate state** (`gate_decisions` / `document_extraction_state` /
  `salience_gate_versions`) — D25–D30 withdrawn. Junk-control is in-call E2 Selection
  (`claim_extraction_decisions`) + D2 redundancy-collapse + content-hash idempotency.
- **No `external_ids` table.** Resolution is registry-self-contained (D20); future internal/domain
  authoritative IDs would attach as *aliases*, never as the canonical `entity_id`.
- **No vectors in Postgres.** All embeddings live in Lance (P1); PG stores opaque `*_ref` keys +
  model/version. HNSW never in OLTP (D8/D23).
- **No document/chunk body text in Postgres** (D37) — bodies in GCS; PG holds offsets + URIs.
- **No fact/opinion/prediction claim type** — unattributed opinions are dropped at Selection;
  attributed stances are kept as ordinary claims → stance observations (D59); nothing is stored as a
  typed claim (§8 reconciliation note).
- **Non-relational facts now get structured validity + supersession (D43 — no longer a non-goal).** A
  fact that yields no relation ("Acme's headcount is 600"; "revenue \$5M for FY2023") becomes an
  **observation** (§9.A) carrying bi-temporal validity: a changing value supersedes (interval-capped),
  and incompatible **same-period** values ("\$5M" vs "\$7M" for FY2023) both stand under a shared
  `contradiction_group` — surfaced, never silently resolved. Adjudicated by entity-blocking + the D4
  cascade, fail-safe to coexist; **no governed attribute typing.** (This was previously a non-goal
  awaiting an "E3 proposition-fact layer"; the observation layer *is* that layer, kept deliberately
  untyped — see `observations_design.md`.)
- **No multi-interval / recurring / un-datable claim validity (D41).** The single
  `claim_valid_from`/`until` interval does not model recurrence ("every Q4") or anchor-events that
  can't be dated at extraction ("as of the merger"); D31 decomposition absorbs most multi-span
  sentences into atomic single-interval claims. The documented upgrade is an expressivity child table
  (btree-indexed, D23-restamped), built only on measured demand (§17).

## 17. Open spikes / recommended decision revisits (measure before locking)

Per CLAUDE.md, numbers are starting points. Items that may move the schema or a decision:

1. ~~**`relation_evidence` partitioning — amend D23.**~~ **RESOLVED (D23).** D23 now records
   `HASH(relation_id)`, PRIMARY KEY (`relation_id`, `claim_id`), and 64 static migration-created
   children. Relation hydration prunes to one partition and evidence-once is DB-enforced. The
   partition count remains a measured starting point in the registries §11 corpus-slice load test.
2. ~~**GIN blocking index shape — reconcile tenancy and D23.**~~ **RESOLVED (D68, D23,
   `registries_design.md` §§1 and 9).** Each deployment has its own Postgres instance/schema;
   `deployment_id` is constant and remains structural defense in depth. The three blocking GIN
   indexes are single-column, and `btree_gin` is not required. The rejected shared-database
   alternative and its deployment-leading composite indexes are recorded in D68 rather than left
   as an implementer choice.
3. **Embedding dimension** (questions Q3): pins `pipeline_component_versions.embedding_dim` and the
   re-embedding batch path — the hardest thing to change later.
4. **Logical-FK auditor cost**: confirm the periodic orphan and worker-owned logical-uniqueness
   checks over partitioned tables stay cheap enough to run often; else reconsider selective real
   FKs. The evidence joins' pair duplicates are not part of this spike because their primary keys
   enforce evidence-once in the database.
5. **K-provenance granularity**: whether `knowledge_artifact_evidence` at claim grain is affordable,
   or should coarsen to relation/community grain for the largest K1 summaries.
6. **Un-merge ↔ supersession ripple** (registries §11 spike 3): verify replaying
   `merge_events.pre_merge_membership_snapshot` correctly re-adjudicates relation windows closed
   under a merged identity (`relation_adjudications.superseded_by` supports it; the procedure needs a
   test).
7. ~~**P3/D40 wording reconciliation.**~~ **RESOLVED** — the cross-link-only model is adopted
   everywhere (D40 refinement note; `requirements_v3.md` §Plane P, `overall_design.md` §5,
   README updated; `questions.md` #25 closed). This schema already followed the binding design;
   no schema change was needed.
8. **Snapshot retention depth** (latest-only vs latest-N for `communities`/`entity_graph_metrics`):
   pick the debugging-history depth against storage cost.
9. **Claim asserted-validity (D41) — measure before locking.** (a) Precision/recall of the extracted
   `claim_valid_*` interval on a golden slice + a per-fact canary for window false-extraction (D35).
   (b) Fiscal-calendar expansion ("FY2023" ≠ calendar 2023 for off-calendar years) — `precision` + the
   grounded source substring keep a wrong expansion auditable, but exact resolution is an
   extraction-quality spike. (c) Whether the optional PG partial btree on `claim_valid_*` is ever
   needed (vs. Lance-only filtering) — load-test write-amplification against D23 first. (d) If
   recurrence / un-datable anchor-events prove load-bearing, the expressivity child table (btree-only,
   D23-restamped) is the documented upgrade — a named alternative, not a deferral.
10. **Invalidated relation retention in P2 (D69).** The executable default is unbounded by age:
    `v_graph_relates` retains every relation whose survivor-redirected endpoints are emitted active
    nodes. Measure snapshot size, rebuild duration, and transaction-time query demand at target scale.
    Only a subsequent binding P2 design revision may introduce a finite hot-snapshot horizon and its
    truthful fallback contract; this spike supplies evidence, not a hidden Phase-0 value.
