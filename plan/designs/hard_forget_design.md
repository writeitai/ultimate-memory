# Hard-forget design — one fail-closed lineage purge

> **Status:** current — D74; resolves `questions.md` #24 and gates WP-7.5.
> Normal deletion remains `evidence_lifecycle_design.md` §8 / schema §13.1. This document owns
> only irreversible hard-forget and restore non-resurrection.

## 1. Contract and boundary

Hard-forget removes one document lineage's contribution and source-bearing payloads from every
library-controlled active store. After completion, semantic, verbatim, graph, K, and browse reads
cannot surface content unique to that lineage, and their public negative is the same as for content
that never existed (S55). Information independently supported by another live lineage remains: the
operation forgets a source contribution, not every independently obtained copy of a fact.

The library owns:

- the portable, content-free forget manifest and its append/replay port;
- the fail-closed admission barrier;
- the PostgreSQL scrub and existing lifecycle/counting cascade;
- exact object-store, P1, P2/P3, and K adapter hooks;
- idempotent replay after restore; and
- a deterministic S55 + restore canary.

The library does **not** choose backup schedules, retention periods, storage-provider lifecycle
rules, remote Git hosting, or legal policy. An adapter must make its declared active surface honor a
purge; physical backup expiry remains an operator/`ultimate-memory-cloud` concern under D60.

Hard-forget is lineage-scoped. Version deletion remains reversible/audit-preserving normal deletion.
Entity-wide or arbitrary-text erasure is an explicit non-goal and is not hidden inside this
workflow.

## 2. One durable intent: the portable forget manifest

The request is accepted only after a versioned `ForgetManifest` has been appended successfully
through `ForgetManifestPort`. The port is the durable source of forget intent; the PostgreSQL row is
an exact materialization plus execution progress, not an independent decision ledger.

The v1 manifest contains no source text, names, provider URIs, prompts, or prose. It contains only:

- schema version, `forget_id`, `deployment_id`, `doc_id`, and `requested_at`;
- a SHA-256 fingerprint of `(deployment_id, source_kind, source_ref)` when a stable source identity
  exists, plus every raw `content_hash` observed for the lineage;
- exact non-content row IDs that must be removed from a restored P1 index (chunks, claims, relation
  and observation facts whose last live support was this lineage, and entities whose last live
  mention was this lineage);
- exact immutable object keys/prefixes that may contain the source;
- pre-forget P2/P3 snapshot prefixes; and
- K artifact IDs whose body, curation sidecar, or history ever cited the lineage's evidence.

IDs and hashes are retained because replay must still work when PostgreSQL has already scrubbed the
payload columns or when only one external store was restored. The manifest is immutable and
idempotent by `forget_id`: appending the same bytes succeeds; reusing the ID for different bytes is
a typed conflict.

`ForgetManifestPort` has only two responsibilities: append one immutable manifest and enumerate
manifests for a deployment. Its storage must be outside the ordinary data-restore set it protects.
The self-host adapter uses a dedicated append-only local root; the cloud implementation and its
durability live in `ultimate-memory-cloud`. WP-7.7 export/import carries the same manifest format
and imports manifests before data becomes readable.

The erasure capabilities are narrow protocols implemented by the already-selected adapters:
`ObjectPurgePort`, `P1PurgePort`, `ProjectionPurgePort`, and `KGitPurgePort`. Each takes a typed
manifest subset and must be idempotent. The self-host LocalFS/Lance/local-Git adapters and reference
object/P1/mount/K adapters are both required in WP-7.5; these are purge capabilities of D61's
existing stores, not alternative engines or new provider families.

### 2.1 PostgreSQL materialization and work identity

The schema adds one small, non-partitioned table and one worker stage:

```sql
CREATE TYPE forget_manifest_status AS ENUM ('preparing', 'accepted', 'complete');

CREATE TABLE forget_manifests (
  forget_id            uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  deployment_id        uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES deployments,
  doc_id                uuid NOT NULL,
  schema_version        smallint NOT NULL,
  manifest_hash         text,
  manifest              jsonb,
  source_identity_hash  text,
  content_hashes        text[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  status                forget_manifest_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'preparing',
  prepared_at           timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  accepted_at           timestamptz,
  completed_at          timestamptz,
  last_verified_at      timestamptz,
  UNIQUE (deployment_id, doc_id),
  UNIQUE (deployment_id, forget_id),
  CHECK ((status = 'preparing') OR
         (manifest_hash IS NOT NULL AND manifest IS NOT NULL AND accepted_at IS NOT NULL)),
  CHECK ((status = 'complete') = (completed_at IS NOT NULL))
);
CREATE INDEX ix_forget_source_guard
  ON forget_manifests (deployment_id, source_identity_hash)
  WHERE source_identity_hash IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX ix_forget_content_guard ON forget_manifests USING gin (content_hashes);
```

`pipeline_component` gains `forgetter` and `pipeline_stage` gains the unlaned `hard_forget` stage.
Its one `processing_state` row uses the existing `document` target, `target_id = doc_id`, the
manifest hash as `content_hash`, and the registered `hard-forget-v1` component version. The table
holds the immutable manifest, irreversible ingest-guard columns, and three coarse lifecycle states;
attempts, traceback, retry, due time, and DLQ remain exclusively in `processing_state`.

## 3. Admission and request formation

Hard-forget is correctness-first and fail-closed:

1. A request serializes on the deployment's single forget operation, verifies deployment ownership,
   and preflights current authored K pages and compiled-page curation sidecars. If a cited path is
   not owner-redacted, the request returns those paths before changing admission. The library never
   invents replacement authored prose.
2. One PostgreSQL transaction inserts the `preparing` row. That row is the admission barrier: new
   public reads/ingests/admin mutations, ordinary work claims, mount publication, and unrelated
   rebuilds refuse with `forget_in_progress`. Already-running ordinary work is allowed to finish.
3. After the ordinary work ledger drains, the coordinator repeats K preflight against the current
   Git revision and takes the repeatable-read manifest inventory. Because ordinary commits and
   claims are now barred, this is the frozen acceptance cut. If the repeated preflight fails before
   any portable append attempt, the transaction deletes the `preparing` row and admission reopens.
4. The complete manifest and its hash are committed to the local row **before** calling the port.
   The coordinator then appends the exact bytes idempotently and marks the row `accepted`. Only that
   successful append makes the request accepted and enqueues the one `hard_forget` processing row.

A crash while the row is `preparing` is not an ordinary forgotten failure. If the manifest is not
yet stored, readiness repeats drain, final preflight, and inventory; once it is stored, readiness
retries the exact idempotent append. If no append was attempted and final preflight refuses, it
safely removes the row; after an append attempt starts, an ambiguous error stays fail-closed and
retries because the remote append may have succeeded. Enumeration also rematerializes a manifest
whose append succeeded just before the local status update.

The admission barrier is a **composition/perimeter rule**, not a guard inside every spine method.
It blocks traffic and ordinary work claims; it explicitly authorizes only the coordinator for that
`forget_id` and the coordinator's direct calls to the existing lifecycle, rebuild, K, object, and P1
services. Those internal calls do not re-enter public admission, so the purge cannot deadlock on its
own barrier. Hard-forget is rare; temporary deployment unavailability is the deliberate price for
one understandable correctness path.

The completed manifest remains an irreversible ingest guard. A later ingest with the same stable
source fingerprint or one of the forgotten content hashes is rejected rather than silently
resurrecting the lineage. There is no bypass flag. Deliberately accepting that material again is a
new policy decision and belongs in a new deployment, not an accidental restore path.

## 4. The one resumable workflow

One `hard_forget` processing row runs the following stages in order. Each stage is idempotent; the
ordinary work ledger supplies attempts, traceback visibility, retry, and DLQ handling. No campaign
table or deletion-specific scheduler is added.

1. **Normal lifecycle first.** Reuse the lineage-deletion/currency path: tombstone every version,
   end current testimony, recount shared facts, close facts with no current support, retire entities
   with no surviving mentions, and emit the existing K tombstone delta. This preserves D54's
   distinct-lineage counting and prevents hard-forget from becoming a second truth transition.
2. **PostgreSQL scrub.** Delete source-exclusive chunks, claims, occurrences, mentions, sections,
   extraction/audit payloads, review payloads, and evidence links. Clear source refs, titles, URIs,
   errors, free-text rationales/features, locators, and representation metadata associated only with
   the lineage. Shared facts and entities survive only when independently supported; exclusive
   observations are removed/scrubbed and exclusive entities remain non-readable retired handles
   with their names/aliases/profile text cleared. The content-free forget row, IDs, hashes, currency
   transition facts, and aggregate counts may remain.
3. **Raw and artifact objects.** `ObjectPurgePort` deletes every manifest raw, artifact, asset, and
   transcript key/prefix. A deduplicated content object is deleted only when no other live lineage
   references it; otherwise the other lineage remains the lawful owner of that identical byte
   object. Missing keys count as success. Projection snapshot prefixes are handled in stage 5.
4. **P1.** `P1PurgePort` deletes the manifest's chunk, claim, exclusive-fact, and exclusive-entity
   rows and compacts the affected tables. It accepts IDs, never provider filters or SQL fragments.
   Hydration was already a correctness backstop; this step removes the stale nominated payload too.
5. **P2 and P3.** Use the existing `GraphRebuildWorker` and `CorpusFsBuilder` to publish clean
   snapshots from the scrubbed spine. Then delete every manifest-listed older snapshot prefix and
   its registry/analytics rows. Readers and mounts may reopen only the new pointers; self-host cache
   cleanup is part of the projection adapter's purge acknowledgement, not a best-effort side task.
6. **K.** Compiled pages recompile through the existing driver without the forgotten evidence.
   `KGitPurgePort` then removes every affected body/curation path from all reachable Git history and
   re-adds only its already-sanitized current file. This intentionally discards unrelated history
   of an affected path rather than risking residual source text. Authored/curation preflight makes
   this mechanical; the library never rewrites their prose. Archived writer/planner transcripts in
   the manifest are object-store payloads and were deleted in stage 3.
7. **Verify and reopen.** Production verification proves every manifest ID, hash, key/prefix, old
   projection version, P1 row, and forbidden K reference is absent from its declared active store;
   PostgreSQL has no remaining source-bearing payload owned only by the lineage; and public lookup
   by the forgotten IDs returns the ordinary never-existed negative. The planted unique token and
   five-channel envelope equality are test-fixture assertions, not production inputs. Only then is
   the manifest marked complete and the deployment barrier opened.

If any adapter throws or verification fails, the original exception remains visible, the work row
retries/dead-letters normally, and the barrier remains closed. There is no partial-success response.

## 5. Restore and import non-resurrection

Every serving composition has one readiness step before it accepts traffic:

1. enumerate the deployment's portable manifests and materialize any missing PostgreSQL rows;
2. for **every** manifest, including locally `complete` records, re-honor its exact object, P1, old
   projection/cache/mount, and K erasure through the idempotent purge capabilities;
3. replay the full spine + clean-rebuild workflow when PostgreSQL is unsanitized or its current
   projection pointers do not resolve to verified clean snapshots built after the accepted
   manifest; and
4. run mechanical production verification, update `last_verified_at`, and only then report ready.

`complete` means the workflow once succeeded; it never means external stores may be skipped
forever. Cheap exact deletes are reissued. The K adapter records a store-local acknowledgement ref
after history erasure and validates it on every `honor` call; losing/restoring that ref triggers the
same path erasure again. Such acknowledgements are receipts/cache only—the portable manifest is the
sole intent. Projection adapters likewise delete every manifest-listed old durable prefix and local
serving copy even when PostgreSQL still points at a clean current snapshot.

Readiness stays false until re-honor/replay and S55 verification complete. Therefore restoring an older
PostgreSQL dump, object bucket, P1 dataset, P2/P3 snapshot, K remote, or any combination cannot make
forgotten data queryable: the append-only manifest lives outside that restore and re-closes the
barrier first. The restore path is not special purge machinery; it feeds the same worker.

An operator that omits or loses the manifest store cannot truthfully claim safe restore. The OSS
surface reports that as a hard readiness failure rather than guessing. Provider backup deletion and
expiry remain operational obligations, but no provider backup may be mounted as an active serving
store without this replay gate.

## 6. Rejected complexity and explicit limitations

- No distributed transaction or rollback across PostgreSQL, object storage, Lance, snapshots, and
  Git. Append-first + idempotent replay + fail-closed admission is smaller and safer.
- No semantic "find similar private text" eraser. Exact lineage provenance, IDs, keys, citations,
  and source/content fingerprints are the boundary.
- No soft-delete mode hidden in hard-forget. Normal deletion already owns reversible audit history.
- No backup scheduler, retention setting, provider lifecycle policy, deletion dashboard, or hosted
  control plane in the library.
- No machine-authored redaction of authored K content. A typed preflight makes accountable
  redaction a prerequisite instead of leaving a half-complete operation.
- No claim that immutable projections purge "for free." A clean rebuild changes the pointer;
  explicit deletion removes the old bytes and local serving copies.

## 7. WP-7.5 acceptance

The deterministic test plants a unique token in one lineage and independently supported control
facts, exercises every retrieval channel, creates P1 rows, multiple P2/P3 snapshots, compiled and
authored K citations, object artifacts, and archived transcripts, then:

1. proves authored/curation preflight blocks before acceptance;
2. redacts those owner-controlled files and completes hard-forget;
3. proves the unique token and source-exclusive IDs are absent everywhere while independent facts
   survive;
4. proves forgotten and never-existed public envelopes are equal;
5. restores the whole pre-forget fixture while retaining the manifest root and proves readiness
   blocks, replays, and returns S55 to green; and
6. after a completed forget, independently restores each of object storage, P1, P2/P3 serving
   copies, and K while leaving PostgreSQL `complete`, proving each readiness pass re-honors the
   manifest instead of trusting the local completion bit.

The canary uses deterministic providers and makes no hosted LLM calls. Focused component tests cover
manifest idempotency/conflicts, ingest guards, missing-object idempotency, adapter failure visibility,
and the barrier never reopening on a failed stage.
