# The Observation Layer — Non-Graph Facts with Temporal Validity (Design)

How the system records and time-travels facts that are **about one entity but not links between two
entities** — a headcount, a balance, a fiscal revenue, a founding date, a status — *without* forcing
them into the typed graph and *without* a governed attribute vocabulary. Binding design for decision
**D43**. It sits beside the **relations** layer (D2–D5/D18, unchanged) and builds on D3 (supersession
over verdicts, never claims), D4 (the cheap-first blocking cascade), D6 (validity has one home), D8
(vectors live in Lance), D18 (the graph holds only entities), and D41 (claims carry an immutable
asserted-validity interval).

> **Reading this cold (CLAUDE.md Rule 1).** You need no prior context. A **claim** is an atomic,
> immutable, natural-language assertion *as a source made it* (the evidence record — never edited). A
> **relation** is a believed `(subject_entity → predicate → object_entity)` fact — the kind a graph can
> hold as an edge. An **observation** (this doc) is a believed fact whose object is a **value or
> statement about a single entity** ("Acme's headcount is 600"), *not* a link to another entity — so it
> is **not** a graph edge. **Bi-temporal** means two clocks: *valid-time* (when the fact held in the
> world — `valid_from`/`valid_until`) and *transaction-time* (when we believed it —
> `ingested_at`/`invalidated_at`). **Supersession** = a newer belief closing an older one's validity
> window. **Blocking** = cheaply narrowing to the handful of existing rows a new fact might conflict
> with, before spending any expensive comparison.

## 1. Two canonical layers, split by what a fact *is*

A document yields claims; normalization (E3) turns claims into the facts the system *believes*. Those
facts come in two shapes, and D43 keeps them in **two separate canonical tables** rather than one:

- **Relations** — both ends are entities: `(Alice) —works_for→ (Acme)`. Typed (governed predicate),
  because a graph needs typed edges. This is the **only** layer that projects to the graph (P2).
- **Observations** — the object is a *value or statement* about one entity: `(Acme) · headcount · 600`,
  `(Acme) · fiscal_revenue · $5M (FY2023)`. A value like `600` or `$5M` is not an entity and by D18 can
  never be a graph node — so observations are **not** graph edges and never enter P2.

Both carry the same bi-temporal windows and the same supersession machinery *in spirit*, so a changing
headcount time-travels exactly as a changing employment does. They differ in two ways that matter:

| | Relations | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| object | another **entity** | a **value/statement** about the subject |
| typed by | a **governed predicate** (registry) | **nothing** — no attribute vocabulary |
| supersession slot | `(subject, predicate, object)` exact key | the **resolved entity** (+ semantic narrowing) |
| projects to graph (P2)? | **yes** (D18) | **no** |
| projects to search (P1/Lance)? | yes (fact-label) | yes (observation label + optional value) |

**Why two tables, not one merged "facts" table.** A relation and an observation can never describe the
*same* belief (entity-object vs value-object are disjoint), so the D6 "one belief home" rule — which
exists to stop the *same* fact living in two places and drifting — is not at stake. Two simple,
disjoint layers beat one polymorphic table whose every row must carry both an entity-object arm and a
literal-object arm. (A unified typed table *was* designed and rejected — see §4.)

### Running example

- **Doc B** (a 2024 filing): *"Acme's headcount was 500 at year-end 2023; revenue was \$5M for FY2023."*
- **Doc C** (a 2025 report): *"Acme now employs around 600 people."*
- **Doc D** (a different 2024 source): *"Acme's FY2023 revenue was \$7M."*

E3 writes three observations on the entity **Acme**: headcount-500 (valid from 2023-12-31),
revenue-\$5M (FY2023), revenue-\$7M (FY2023); then Doc C adds headcount-600 (2025). We want:
*"headcount mid-2024?"* → **500**; *"headcount now?"* → **600**; *"FY2023 revenue?"* → **both \$5M and
\$7M, surfaced as a conflict** (never one silently chosen). That is exactly what the layer delivers.

## 2. What an observation is

An observation is a believed value/statement about **one resolved entity**, with bi-temporal validity
and evidence. The row is deliberately lean (full DDL: `postgres_schema_design.md` §9.A):

- `subject_entity_id` — the **anchor**, always a resolved canonical entity. This is the supersession
  blocking key.
- `statement` — the canonical natural-language form of the observed fact ("Acme's headcount is 600",
  "Acme's FY2023 revenue was \$5M"). This holds **everything** the value carries — the number, the unit,
  and any reporting period ("FY2023") — and is embedded in Lance for semantic narrowing and retrieval.
  There is deliberately **no structured `value` column, no period column, no fingerprint**: the value and
  the period are matched *semantically* by the adjudicator, exactly the way the *property* is (see §3).
  This keeps the layer fully consistent with its own untyped premise — nothing about a fact is given a
  typed slot. (If cross-entity numeric range queries — "all entities with revenue > \$5M" — ever become a
  real requirement, an optional structured `value` is a clean, additive change at that point; it is left
  out now because the core memory use is entity-anchored recall, not cross-entity range scans.)
- the **bi-temporal** quartet (`valid_from`/`valid_until` = world-validity, `ingested_at`/`invalidated_at`
  = belief-time), a generated `status` mirror of `invalidated_at` (one validity home, D6),
  `evidence_count` (distinct current-testimony lineages supporting — D54) / `contradict_count`
  (distinct current-testimony lineages contradicting — note this is distinct from *conflicting
  observations*, which are linked by `contradiction_group`),
  `confidence`, and `contradiction_group` (set when two observations conflict and both must stand).

There is **no governed attribute key, no `value_domain`, no `unit_dimension`, no `cardinality`, no
structured value/period column, and no typed exclusion constraint.** The only DB guards are FK-to-entity
and basic temporal sanity. Everything about *which observations are the same thing* and *whether a new
one supersedes* is decided by the
adjudicator (§3), not the schema. (`status` reuses the existing `relation_status` enum — `active` /
`invalidated` — intentionally, as a common fact-status type shared with relations.)

## 3. Supersession by blocking + adjudication (the heart)

This reuses the exact pattern relations use for supersession (D4) — *block cheaply, then adjudicate the
small residue* — with one change: **block on the resolved entity, not on a typed predicate.**

When a claim asserts a value/property about entity *E*:

1. **Block (exact, exhaustive).** Fetch *E*'s **live** observations: `WHERE subject_entity_id = E AND
   invalidated_at IS NULL`. Indexed; most entities have few observations, so this is cheap and — this is
   the key property — **exhaustive for that entity**. Nothing about *E* can be missed.
2. **Narrow (only for hubs).** If *E* has many observations, rank them by **semantic similarity** to the
   new statement (P1/Lance over the observation label) to choose *which to compare first*. This is an
   ordering optimization, not a membership filter: the entity block already makes **all** of *E*'s live
   observations *available* (an exact key — no clustering can hide one). Crucially, because `supersede`
   requires a **positive** match (step 3), a prior that top-k ranking happens to skip yields at worst a
   *duplicate coexisting observation* to reconcile later — **never** a wrong supersede. (Contrast pure
   clustering, where a mis-clustered prior is invisible and silently duplicated.)
3. **Adjudicate (cheap-first cascade, D4).** Every outcome below first requires a **positive match on the
   same thing** — the adjudicator reading both `statement`s and judging *same property* (and, for a
   period figure, *same reporting period* and *compatible value*) **semantically**, exactly the way it
   judges "same property". There is no typed period/value column to lean on; "FY2023" vs "fiscal 2023"
   is an LLM equivalence call, just like "headcount" vs "staff count". Then:
   - **evidence** — same property, same value, overlapping validity → don't insert a row; add evidence to
     the existing observation and bump `evidence_count`. Collapse is **adjudicated (best-effort)**.
   - **supersede** — same property, an **effective state** (headcount/balance/status), value *changed*
     over time → **cap** the prior observation's `valid_until` at the new `valid_from` and insert the new
     one. The prior stays *true for its window* (`invalidated_at` stays NULL). (Headcount 500 → 600.)
   - **contradict / coexist** — same property **and** same reporting period, *incompatible* value → both
     stand, with a shared `contradiction_group`; the recipe surfaces both, the system never picks. (FY2023
     *revenue* \$5M vs \$7M conflict; FY2023 *revenue* vs FY2023 *profit* do **not** — different property;
     FY2023 vs Q1-2023 do **not** — different period.)
   - **new** — a different property, period, or thing → insert independently, no interaction.

   *(The D55 `retract` path — a living document withdrawing a fact's sole support — routes
   through this same state-vs-measurement judgment: a withdrawn **state** observation gets its
   `valid_until` capped; a withdrawn **measurement** gets `invalidated_at` instead, because the
   no-cap rule below holds even under retraction — the figure stays true of its period; what
   ends is the belief. Recorded as `retracted_source_removal`.)*

   **The no-cap rule (D43).** A `supersede` (capping `valid_until`) applies **only** to a *changing
   effective state*. A **measurement / fixed-period figure** ("FY2023 revenue") is **never** capped on
   valid-time — it does not stop being true at period-end; its window stays open, and a conflicting
   same-period figure goes to *contradict/coexist*, never *supersede*. The adjudicator decides
   state-vs-measurement from the `statement` (semantic), not from a typed column. This is the rule that
   replaces the dropped `about_period` columns: rather than recording the period structurally, the
   system simply never caps a period figure and lets same-period conflicts coexist.
4. **Fail safe — a binding adjudicator contract (not just a hope).** This is the honest core of the
   untyped design: "never silently resolve" is **policy enforced in E3 + eval**, not a schema invariant.
   The binding rules:
   - A **`supersede`** (capping a prior `valid_until`) is permitted **only** against a *positively
     matched* prior whose adjudicator margin clears an explicit threshold, **and every cap writes an
     `observation_adjudications` reason row.** No silent caps.
   - Below threshold, or on any *incomplete* comparison, the outcome **must** be `coexist`/`new` —
     never `supersede`. Coexisting is always safe (both surfaced); a wrong-but-confident supersede is
     the one forbidden outcome, and these rules make the *failure mode* a duplicate, not an overwrite.
   - A **contradiction precision/recall eval gate** on the golden set is an **acceptance criterion** for
     shipping the adjudicator (this is the E2/E3 eval harness flagged as unowned in `questions.md` — it
     becomes load-bearing here).
   That contract — not the DDL — is how "contradictions are surfaced, never silently resolved"
   (requirements_v3) is honored without a typed schema gate. The design does not pretend the DB
   guarantees it.

### Worked examples

**Supersede — a changing headcount.**

| step | what happens |
|---|---|
| Doc B → "headcount 500 (year-end 2023)" | block on Acme: none match → insert **O1** (`statement`="Acme headcount 500", `valid_from`=2023-12-31 normalized from "year-end 2023", open). Headcount is a *changing state*. |
| Doc C → "≈600" (2025) | block on Acme finds O1; positive same-property match, an effective state, later value → **cap O1** (`valid_until` ≈ 2025-01, normalized from the report date), insert **O2** ("…600", open). An `observation_adjudications` row records `outcome=supersede` with its reason. |
| query *"headcount mid-2024?"* | `subject=Acme ∧ semantic≈headcount ∧ valid_from ≤ t < valid_until ∧ invalidated_at IS NULL` → **O1 = 500**. |

(`valid_from`/`valid_until` are normalized from the source's temporal language — "year-end 2023", "as
of", "now" → the report date — via the claim's D41 asserted validity, not from ingestion time.)

**Both-stand — conflicting FY2023 revenue.** Doc B "FY2023 revenue \$5M" and Doc D "FY2023 revenue \$7M"
each become an observation whose `statement` carries the value *and* the period. The adjudicator reads
both and judges same-entity + **same property (revenue)** + **same period (FY2023)** + incompatible value
→ and, by the **no-cap rule**, a fixed-period figure is never superseded → **contradiction**: both kept
with open windows and a shared `contradiction_group`; the recipe returns both. No typed
period/`measurement_period`/`cardinality` column was needed — the period match is the same kind of
semantic judgment as the property match. Correctly **not** a conflict: FY2023 *revenue* vs FY2023
*profit* (different property), or FY2023 vs Q1-2023 revenue (different period) — both coexist.

**No recall hole.** Suppose Acme has 40 observations. A new headcount claim blocks on Acme (all 40 found,
exact), then semantic-ranks to compare against the existing *headcount* one first. Even if the semantic
rank were poor, the prior headcount is still *in the candidate set* (the entity block is exhaustive) — at
worst the adjudicator spends a bit more. Contrast a pure semantic-cluster approach, where a mis-clustered
prior headcount would be **invisible** and silently duplicated. Anchoring to the resolved entity is what
buys this.

### Supersession appends — an observation is a time-slice, never an in-place edit

An observation is **a time-slice of belief, not a mutable current-state record.** Supersession does two
things, *neither of which touches the old `statement`*: it (1) **caps** the prior observation's
`valid_until` (to the successor's `valid_from`) and (2) **inserts a new row** for the new value. The old
row persists, `statement` intact:

| | id | statement | valid_from | valid_until | invalidated_at | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| after Doc B | O1 | "Acme headcount 500" | 2023-12-31 | NULL | NULL | active |
| after Doc C supersedes | O1 | "Acme headcount 500" *(unchanged)* | 2023-12-31 | **2025-01 (capped)** | NULL | active |
|  | O2 | "Acme headcount 600" | 2025-01 | NULL | NULL | active |

- **The "current state" is a query, not a row.** The live value is `valid_until IS NULL` (or covering
  `now`) `AND invalidated_at IS NULL` (→ O2 = 600); the history is the *set* of rows (→ "headcount in
  2024?" = O1 = 500). Overwriting O1's statement would destroy that history — the whole reason
  supersession appends rather than rewrites (same as relations, D3, and the immutable-claims principle).
- **`status='active'` ≠ "current value".** `status` only mirrors `invalidated_at` — *"do we still
  believe this was true?"*. O1 stays `active` after being superseded, because we still believe Acme had
  500 *then* (it *ended*, it wasn't *wrong*). "Is it the value now?" is the valid-time question; "was it
  ever retracted as a mistake?" is `status`/`invalidated_at`.
- **Never changes:** `statement` and the identity it carries. **Can change:** `valid_until` (the cap),
  `invalidated_at` (only on learning it was *wrong*, not merely ended), the cached
  `evidence_count`/`contradict_count`/`confidence`, `contradiction_group`. A *correction* to a value is a
  **new** observation (or invalidate + new), not an edit. (By the no-cap rule, a fixed-period figure is
  never even capped — a conflicting figure becomes a second coexisting row.)

### The add-observation worker, cheapest-first

Governing principle (from D4): **write-side LLM cost scales with *ambiguity*, not volume** — most writes
resolve with zero LLM calls; only the ambiguous residue escalates. The worker arrives with upstream work
already done in the E2/E3 extraction call — **don't redo it**: the **subject entity resolved** (the ER
T0–T4 cascade), the `statement`, the **asserted validity** (D41), the routing decision (single-entity
value → observation), and often the claim's embedding (E2 embeds claims for P1).

1. **Block (indexed, no LLM).** Fetch the entity's live observations via the `ix_observations_block`
   partial index (`subject_entity_id` + `invalidated_at IS NULL`). One lookup; few rows for most
   entities — the exact, exhaustive candidate set.
2. **Novelty gate (cheap signals, no LLM — most volume exits here).**
   - **zero candidates** → **new**: insert + link evidence.
   - **exact / near-exact** match (same property + value + overlapping window, via precomputed-embedding
     or lexical compare) → **evidence**: add an `observation_evidence` row, bump `evidence_count`, **no
     new observation**. *(The "200 docs say the same thing" corpus-redundancy case — the biggest saver.)*
   - **clear novelty** (similarity below a low, golden-tuned threshold) → **new**: insert + link.
   - For a **hub entity**, the same vector step top-k ranks *which* candidates to compare (cheap math); a
     skipped far candidate costs at most a duplicate row, never a wrong supersede.
3. **Adjudicate the residue only (cheap → frontier).** Only similar-but-not-identical candidates escalate
   the D4 cascade: deterministic value/period compare → small model → frontier LLM for the survivors. The
   adjudicator decides same-property (+ same-period for a figure) and the outcome under the no-cap rule
   (state → supersede; measurement → contradict/coexist; same value → evidence; else new), and **fails
   safe to coexist** below the supersede margin.
4. **Write (one transaction).** Apply the outcome — an evidence row; or cap + new observation +
   `observation_adjudications` reason (supersede); or new observation + shared `contradiction_group` +
   adjudication (contradict); or new (new). The `(observation_id, claim_id)` PK makes retries no-ops.
5. **Label + embed (batched/deferred).** Reuse `statement` as the label where possible (no extra call);
   batch the embeddings that *future* blocking will compare against.

**Where each write lands (the cost ladder):**

| case | frequency | cost |
|---|---|---|
| entity has no live observations (first mention) | high | **0 LLM** — insert |
| exact / near-exact re-assertion (corpus redundancy) | **highest** | **0 LLM** — evidence-collapse |
| clearly novel | high | **0 LLM** — insert |
| similar-but-not-identical | low | deterministic → small model |
| genuinely ambiguous | lowest | frontier LLM |

**Cost levers:** the block is one indexed lookup, not a scan; the two no-LLM exits (first-mention and
exact-duplicate) absorb the bulk of volume; precomputed embeddings drive the novelty gate and hub
narrowing; upstream work (entity, embedding, asserted validity) is reused; claims are **batched per
entity** (a doc naming Acme 5× → one block fetch + batched adjudication); and the
`observation_adjudications` log makes decisions **replayable on rebuild** instead of re-calling the LLM
(D7). It is deliberately the *same* cascade and thresholds as relation supersession (D4) — blocked on the
resolved entity instead of `(subject, predicate)` — so it's one engine shared across both layers.

## 4. Why no typing (the honest rationale)

A fuller design — a **unified, typed `facts` table** with a governed attribute vocabulary
(`value_domain`, `unit_dimension`, `cardinality`) and DB-enforced, schema-gated literal supersession —
was designed and **rejected** (preserved in a closed PR, not on main). The reasons, plainly:

- **The attribute space is not enumerable.** Trying to register every property a source might assert
  about an entity fragments exactly like free-text predicates would, and forces extra LLM typing calls
  whose output is brittle.
- **The typing existed only to make literal supersession *schema-enforced*.** If supersession is
  *adjudicated* (as relations always have been), none of `value_domain`/`unit_dimension`/`cardinality`
  is needed — the adjudicator decides value-equality and supersede-vs-coexist at comparison time, on the
  same LLM call it already makes.
- **Merging graph and non-graph facts under one polymorphic table** is a heavy mental model (an
  entity-object arm XOR a literal-object arm, multiple exclusion constraints, registry-locking triggers)
  for no truth-level benefit, since the two are disjoint (§1).

What we give up by going untyped is real and named in §7: value-equality and supersede-vs-coexist become
**adjudicator judgments + an eval gate**, not schema invariants. For a *memory* system (not a financial
ledger), dexterity and a simple mental model are worth that trade — and the fail-safe-to-coexist default
keeps the one hard guarantee intact.

## 5. Retrieval — through the projections

Observations are **storage**; queries go through projections (D9), exactly like everything else:

- **P1 / Lance** — each observation's `statement`/label is embedded for **semantic search**:
  *"what has Acme's headcount been over time?"* resolves Acme, pulls its observations, orders by
  `valid_from`.
- **P2 / graph** — observations are **never** projected (a value is not a node — D18). Only relations
  reach the graph.
- **as-of** — the same bi-temporal filter as relations: valid-time (`valid_from ≤ t < valid_until`) for
  "what was true at T", transaction-time (`ingested_at ≤ t < COALESCE(invalidated_at, ∞)`) for "what did
  we believe at T". A **period** query ("FY2023 revenue?") is a *semantic* lookup over `statement`
  (Acme + revenue + FY2023), not a structured-column filter — and because a period figure is never
  capped, both conflicting `contradiction_group` members come back (both surfaced).

The cost of untyped storage shows up here: a query for a *specific* property or value is **semantic**
(over `statement`/label), not an exact typed-key or numeric-column lookup. That is what P1/Lance is built
for. The one thing it does *not* do cheaply is a **cross-entity numeric range scan** ("all entities with
revenue > \$5M") — there is no structured `value` to range over. That is the explicit price of dropping
the typed columns; if such scans become a real requirement, an optional structured `value` is a clean
additive change at that point.

## 6. Schema essentials

Full DDL in `postgres_schema_design.md` §9.A. Three tables, mirroring the relations trio but leaner:

- **`observations`** — the row in §2; entity-anchored, bi-temporal, generated `status`,
  `contradiction_group`, the `statement` + label/embedding refs; FK to `entities` + temporal CHECKs;
  **no structured value/period columns, no typed EXCLUDE, no attribute FK.**
- **`observation_evidence`** — many-to-many join to claims (`HASH(observation_id)`, PK
  `(observation_id, claim_id)` = evidence-once); where corpus redundancy collapses into `evidence_count`.
- **`observation_adjudications`** — the append-only "why" transcript (supersede / contradict / merge),
  by cascade rung, so the non-deterministic adjudication is replayable on rebuild (D7).

## 7. Consequences, residuals, and what to measure

**Invariants preserved:** claims immutable (D2/D3); the graph holds only entities (D18 — observations
never project); validity has one home per fact (D6 — `status` is generated; relations and observations
are disjoint so they cannot drift); asserted-validity feeds but never overrides the believed window
(D41).

**Residuals — measure before locking (thresholds are starting points, not constants):**
1. **Supersede-vs-coexist is an adjudicator judgment, not a schema gate.** A confident-but-wrong
   `supersede` could silently resolve a conflict that should both-stand — the design does **not** pretend
   the DB prevents this. The safeguard is the **binding adjudicator contract of §3.4** (supersede only on
   a positively-matched prior above an explicit margin, with a persisted reason; else coexist) plus a
   contradiction **precision/recall eval gate** that is an **acceptance criterion** for shipping the
   adjudicator (the E2/E3 eval harness — `questions.md` flags it as unowned; this design makes it
   load-bearing and gives it an owner). This is the single biggest correctness risk and the price of
   dropping the typed gate; it fails toward *duplicate coexisting rows*, never silent overwrite.
2. **Adjudication cost.** Each value-claim does an entity block (cheap, indexed) + occasional semantic
   narrowing + an adjudication call — comparable to relation supersession. Load-test the per-write cost
   and the hub-entity tail (entities with many observations) at corpus scale.
3. **Specific-property and same-period matching are both semantic.** With no typed property/period
   column, "is this the same property?" and "is this the same reporting period?" are LLM judgments
   (e.g. "fiscal 2023" ≡ "FY2023"). Measure this on the contradiction golden set; if same-period recall
   proves weak, the additive fallback is an optional canonical period field — not a governed vocabulary.
   No cross-entity numeric range scan is supported (no structured `value`); see §5.
4. **Observation volume vs. relations.** Size `observations`/`observation_evidence` against full
   extraction; decide partitioning by the same logic as `relation_evidence` (`HASH` by id).

**Out of scope (documented non-goals, not deferrals):** observations do **not** carry a governed
attribute vocabulary or schema-enforced supersession; they never enter the graph. **Attributed
stance is IN scope (D59, resolving the former qualitative-belief question):** "Bob opposes the
pricing change" is an ordinary observation anchored on Bob — an effective state (a changed mind
supersedes; "what did Bob think in March?" is an as-of query; conflicting same-time reports
coexist via `contradiction_group`), on this design's machinery unchanged. *Unattributed*
opinion remains dropped at E2 Selection (D31/D34/D59) and becomes neither a relation nor an
observation.
