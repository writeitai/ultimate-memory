# Overall System Design

The architecture that satisfies `plan/requirements/requirements_v3.md`. This document is the
map; per-layer designs (this directory) are the territory. Decision rationale lives in
`decisions.md` (root, cited as D1–D59); supporting research in `plan/analysis/`.

## 1. System overview: three planes (D14)

The system is a DAG across three planes, not a ladder. The plane determines the operational
rules — trigger model, source of truth, mutability, rebuild semantics.

```
 PLANE E — EVIDENCE (per-document chain; Postgres is truth)
            ┌── registries: entities, predicates ──┐
            ▼                  ▼                    ▼
 inputs ─► E0 files ─► E1 chunks ─► E2 claims ─► E3 relations
           (raw+md+         (semchunk,   (claimify,    (normalization,
            PageIndex,      ctx prefix)  coref)        evidence, supersession)
            placement)      │            │   │
                 │          │            │   │      PLANE K — KNOWLEDGE (debounced,
                 │          │            │   │      LLM-compiled; git is truth)
                 │          │            ▼   ▼
                 │          │        K1 general / K2 scopes ─► K3 beliefs

                 ▼          ▼            ▼   ▼      PLANE P — PROJECTIONS (scheduled
            ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐  rebuild; derived, no authority)
            │ P1 search indexes (Lance: chunks,   │
            │    claims, relation fact labels)    │
            │ P2 graph snapshot (LadybugDB)       │
            │ P3 corpus filesystem (GCS tree,     │
            │    mounted read-only to agents)     │
            └─────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
                 RETRIEVAL: API / CLI / MCP / mounted FS
            entry (P1/PG) → expand (P2) → hydrate (PG → GCS); browse (P3)
```

*(Diagram note: the arrows descending into plane P come from the E columns (E0 artifacts → P3;
E1/E2/E3 → P1/P2) — plane P derives from the E spine only. K sits beside that flow: K pages
and P3 cross-link as consumers of each other, but K is never a structural input to any
projection — D40 refined; `e0_files_design.md` §6.)*

| Plane | Trigger | Source of truth | Mutability | "Rebuild" means |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **E** | per-document chain | Postgres | append-only, windows close | n/a — it *is* the truth |
| **K** | debounced/windowed | git repo | agent- and human-edited | re-compile (semantic) |
| **P** | scheduled cycle | none | immutable snapshots | from Postgres, every cycle |

## 2. Stores and sources of truth (D1, D6)

| Store | Role | Authority | Rebuildable from |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Postgres** (Hetzner) | spine: inputs, document/section metadata, chunk metadata, claims, entities, predicates, relations, evidence, validity, processing state, costs | **source of truth** for plane E | — (PITR backups) |
| **GCS — raw** | immutable original files | source of truth for file bytes | — |
| **GCS — artifacts** | per-document markdown + `pageindex.json` + conversion sidecars (E0, D37) | source of truth for converted bodies | E0 re-run by `converter_version` |
| **GCS — corpus fs** | **P3**: corpus organized as a mounted directory tree (D40) | derived | Postgres + artifacts (every cycle) |
| **LanceDB** | **P1**: vector + FTS indexes over chunks, claims, relation fact labels | derived | Postgres |
| **git repo** | plane K: compiled + authored knowledge (K1/K2/K3 tiers, D47) | **source of truth** — irreducibly the human-authored content; compiled pages are semantically regenerable from the spine + recorded inputs (D45/D46) | — (own backups) |
| **LadybugDB** | **P2**: graph projection of entities + relations | derived | Postgres (every cycle) |

Two hard rules: validity/invalidation state exists **only** in Postgres — Lance and Ladybug
carry filtered copies, never independently mutated (D6); and every derived store must be
reproducible by a tested batch path, exercised routinely (D7).

## 3. Core data model (D2, D3, D5)

Worked explainer with examples: `plan/analysis/concepts.md`.

```
documents ─< chunks                    entities ──< entity_aliases
    │                                      │
    └─< claims ──< claim_entity_mentions ──┘        predicates (governed registry)
          │                                              │
          └──< relation_evidence >── relations ──────────┘
               (stance: supports        (subject, predicate, object,
                | contradicts)           valid_from/valid_until,
                                         ingested_at/invalidated_at)
```

- **Documents** — **lineages** (connector-native identity: the Drive file ID, the message ID)
  with append-only **versions** over deduplicated content objects; `snapshot | living` semantics
  per lineage; watched sources ingest edits as versions, reusing unchanged chunks' work (D55/D56).
- **Claims** — immutable NL assertions; identity = assertion-by-a-source; temporally classified and
  carrying an immutable **source-asserted validity interval** (D41); never superseded themselves.
  Claims carry **testimony currency** (D54 — bookkeeping, never validity): counts and default
  search consider *current* testimony; history remains queryable.
- **Relations** — distinct **entity→entity** facts; identity = the fact; bi-temporal validity windows;
  the unit of supersession and contradiction (D3); the only layer projected to the graph (D18).
- **Observations** — non-graph facts about **one entity** (a value/statement: headcount, revenue, a
  status); entity-anchored, **untyped** (no governed attribute vocabulary), same bi-temporal validity;
  supersession adjudicated by entity-blocking + the D4 cascade, fail-safe to coexist (D43). Never enter
  the graph; project to P1/Lance only.
- **Evidence** — many-to-many (for both relations and observations); corpus redundancy collapses into
  evidence counts (free confidence/salience signal).
- **Entities** — canonical registry with aliases, types, cached resolutions; only canonical
  IDs flow downstream.
- **Predicates** — governed vocabulary with `other:` escape and periodic promotion (D5).
- **Ontology** — universal schema.org-aligned core + user extensions anchored to it
  (extend-never-fork), with domain/range constraints; lives in the registries (D15).
  K2 scopes share one entity space and one graph; scope views are registry-declared
  projections, never separate databases (D16).

## 4. Plane E: ingestion pipeline (per-document chain, D12)

Each stage is a Cloud Run worker triggered via Cloud Tasks; each completion enqueues the next
stage for that document. All workers idempotent (content hash + processing version), max 2
retries then dead-letter into Postgres. (Queue topology, steady-state vs backfill lanes,
budget enforcement, and DLQ operations: `orchestration_design.md`, D52–D53.)

1. **E0** (document layer, a chain of idempotent sub-workers — D36; design: `e0_files_design.md`):
   **ingest** (store raw to GCS + `content_hash`) → **convert** (raw → Markdown via the configurable
   module, D38) → **structure** (PageIndex tree + roles + spans + summaries + a **placement hint**,
   D39) → **crossref** (citations). Bodies live in GCS (raw + artifacts buckets); Postgres holds only
   metadata + the queryable section index (D37).
2. **E1** (design: `e1_chunks_design.md`, D57–D58): the **blockizer** derives the deterministic
   block sequence from document.md; PageIndex sections snap to the block grid; semchunk packs
   whole blocks into non-overlapping, section-bounded, anchor-stabilized chunks → context
   (the E1 prefix — or none, if a contextual embedding model is chosen, questions #3) → embed
   → P1. Unchanged blocks reuse prior claims/embeddings across document versions (D56).
3. **E2 → E3** (every chunked document — there is no pre-extraction value gate, D25): coreference
   (D19: in the E2 extraction call, all languages) → **Claimify extraction with in-call Selection**
   (proposition-level verifiability KEEP/REWRITE/DROP — the value filter that replaces any
   pre-extraction gate; the E0 PageIndex section path is fed in so references/boilerplate/intro/
   conclusion drop at proposition grain) → entity resolution (tiered cascade T0–T4, D17, via the
   entity registry) → relation normalization (predicate registry, domain/range D18) →
   **supersession cascade** (D4): novelty gate → `(entity_id, predicate)` blocking over
   relations → cheap-first escalation → write-time outcomes (`supersedes` closes windows,
   `contradicts` flags, `same_as` proposes merges). Registry detail: `registries_design.md`.

Note on P1: search indexes are *written inline* by E-plane workers (chunks/claims/relation
labels embedded as they land) but remain plane-P objects — fully rebuildable from Postgres by
batch, carrying no authority.

## 5. Planes K and P: aggregate derivation (debounced/scheduled, D12)

Neither plane is triggered per document — K is windowed/debounced ("N new claims or T
minutes"), P rebuilds on schedule; both summarize/project across the corpus.

- **K1/K2** (git): a manifest-driven compile system (D45–D47; design: `k_layers_design.md`).
  A **planner** LLM maintains which pages exist and each page's mechanical **routing rule**
  (entity / subtree / predicate / community / doc-set keys); **writer** LLMs (Codex/OpenCode)
  compile one page each from the rule's evidence + the page's human curation + child-page
  summaries; a deterministic **driver** computes staleness by SQL (rule diff + cited-evidence
  changes), schedules writers children-before-parents, and is the repo's only automated
  committer — no merge conflicts, no hot-file machinery. Incremental refresh is exact: the
  stale set *is* the refresh set. Two page kinds (D46): **compiled** (machine-owned body,
  regenerated) and **authored** (human/agent-owned — decisions, to-be designs — never
  regenerated, review-flagged when cited evidence changes). Citations land in
  `knowledge_artifact_evidence`; a periodic **semantic linter** remains as prose quality
  assurance (cross-page contradictions, broken links), no longer the staleness mechanism.
  Repo exposed via MCP + auto-generated `llms.txt`.
- **K3**: the belief tier of the same mechanism (D47): compiled pages whose rules select only
  high-evidence, uncontradicted relations/observations; every belief links
  supporting/contradicting claim IDs; recompiled only when its evidence set changes, never on
  a timer.
- **P2**: full rebuild from Postgres → Parquet → LadybugDB → validated immutable GCS
  snapshot; readers serve read-only copies and hot-swap (D7). Full design:
  `p2_graph_design.md`.
- **P1**: written inline by plane E (see §4); batch rebuild path exercised for embedding
  migrations and drills.
- **P3 — corpus filesystem** (D40): a rebuildable GCS directory tree organizing the corpus for
  agent navigation, **mounted read-only** to agentic workers. Built from E0 placement hints (D39)
  + entities/relations (K is cross-linked, never a structural input — D40 refined; P3 stays
  rebuildable from the E spine); folders by topic/source/entity, leaves linking to
  the E0 artifacts, generated `_index.md`/`llms.txt` at each level. Cross-links with K
  (understanding ↔ source). Full design: `e0_files_design.md` §6.

## 6. Retrieval architecture (D8, D9)

```
entry                          expand                    hydrate
Lance: relations (fact-label   LadybugDB snapshot:       Postgres:
  embeddings + scalar cols),   neighborhood, paths,      relation → evidence
  claims, chunks               as-of traversal           claims → documents
PG: FTS, entity registry       (projected graphs, D10)   → GCS bytes
        └──── RRF fusion ──── graph-distance + evidence-count rerank ────┘
```

- Channels run in parallel; **RRF** fuses; rerankers: graph distance from focal entities,
  evidence count; optional cross-encoder. **Zero LLM calls** on the core path.
- **Projections propose, the spine disposes (D48):** entry channels only *nominate*; every
  result is re-verified by-ID against live Postgres at hydration — staleness can cost recall,
  never correctness.
- **The response envelope (D49):** every answer carries its grain (fact / evidence /
  compiled), inline contradiction co-members, per-source freshness stamps (incl. K page
  staleness + open flags), explicit truncation, and a typed negative taxonomy.
- Composable zero-LLM primitives + **recipes as registry rows** (D50): `relation_hybrid_rrf`,
  `entity_timeline`, `explain`, `claims_as_of` (evidence-grain, barred from current-fact),
  … — MCP tools render from the recipe registry.
- Surfaces (D51): HTTP API, CLI, MCP server, and **four read-only mounts** (P3, E0 artifacts,
  E0 raw — off the navigation path, K repo checkout); **filesystem-first** for agent harnesses
  with full mount/API parity; a shipped **consumption skill** teaches cold agents the memory.
- `valid_at` / `believed_at` supported end-to-end on both time axes, composable across calls.
- Full design: `retrieval_design.md`; scenario battery: `plan/analysis/retrieval_scenarios.md`.

## 7. Deployment topology

- **Postgres on Hetzner**: pgBouncer pooling, TLS for cross-cloud access, PITR backups.
- **Workers on GCP**: Cloud Run jobs, Cloud Tasks queues (rate-limited, 2 retries + DLQ).
- **GCS**: input files, markdown, Parquet exports, graph snapshots.
- **git repo** (plane K): hosted remote + independent backup; written only by the aggregate
  workers and humans.
- Retrieval API holds local LanceDB datasets and LadybugDB snapshots; Postgres is the only
  cross-cloud dependency on the hot path (kept to ID hydration).

## 8. Cross-cutting concerns

- **Cost**: per-layer metering in Postgres; cheap-first cascades everywhere an LLM is
  involved; budgets enforced, not advisory.
- **Versioning**: prompt/model/embedding versions on every artifact; embedding migration is
  a planned batch path (re-embed by version filter).
- **Deletion cascade**: input removal propagates E1→P2; plane K is reached mechanically via
  citations (D45/D46) — compiled pages recompile without the removed evidence, authored pages
  are review-flagged; hard-delete supported (K-repo git-history erasure:
  `k_layers_design.md` §10).
- **Maintenance**: Lance compaction schedule; rebuild drills; semantic linter cadence;
  predicate-registry review.
- **Observability**: pipeline tracing/metrics; DLQ inspection; per-stage throughput and
  spend dashboards.

## 10. Open questions

Tracked in `questions.md` (root). Highest-impact for design work: embedding model choice
(hardest to change), backfill vs. steady-state volumes, hard-delete obligations.
