# Orchestration — Workers, Queues, Lanes, Budgets, DLQ (Design)

How the workers *run*: the operational plane that connects the per-worker designs. The worker
**inventory** — every worker, its behavior contract, its execution class — is
`../analysis/workers.md`; per-worker *semantics* live in the layer designs. This document binds
what none of them owns: queue topology, the steady-state/backfill lane split, budget-enforcement
semantics, dead-letter operations, and the cross-cloud write discipline. Decisions: **D52–D53**
(execution-class and model-family invariants) and **D67** (normalized queue-state ownership),
building on D12 (idempotent workers, retries, DLQ), D7 (replay-not-recall), D16 (deployment
isolation), D23 (scale), D25 (ungated volume).
Numbers here are starting points to measure, not committed constants (CLAUDE.md).

## 1. No workflow engine — the chain is the orchestrator (scope boundary)

There is deliberately **no Airflow / Temporal / Step Functions layer**. The orchestrator is the
composition of three things that already exist:

1. **Cloud Tasks queues** — at-least-once delivery, transport redelivery, rate limiting
   (imposed constraint);
2. **`processing_state`** — state, idempotency, application retries, scheduling, and dead
   letters (D12/D67);
3. **the chain rule** — a completing worker enqueues the next stage for its target.

A workflow engine would duplicate all three, add a second stateful system to operate, and put
pipeline state somewhere other than the spine — against the grain of "state has one home"
(D6). Cross-stage coordination needs nothing more because stages are **independent idempotent
steps**: there is no distributed transaction to manage, only the next enqueue. This is a scope
boundary, not a deferral: a future need (e.g. deadline-bound human-in-the-loop steps spanning
stages) must be argued against this section, not assumed.

Here "retry" in item 1 means retrying a transport delivery. It may produce duplicate pushes but
cannot start another application attempt unless the Postgres row is due and claimable. Handler
attempt count, backoff, and terminal dead-lettering belong only to `processing_state` (D67).

## 2. Queue topology

- **One logical route per `(deployment, stage, lane)`.** Per-deployment isolation is a hard rule (D16 —
  separate instances never share infrastructure paths). Per-*stage* queues exist so backlogs
  do not couple: a slow OCR batch (convert) must not starve extraction; E3's Postgres-heavy
  adjudication is rate-limited independently of E2's LLM-throughput limits. Queue count is
  configuration, not architecture — stages × lanes × deployments is tens of queues, well
  inside platform limits. For lane-managed plane-E rows, `lane` is `steady` or `backfill`.
  K/P debounce or schedule jobs set `lane IS NULL`; their route is the single unlaned
  `(deployment, stage, NULL)` route, not a third lane. Physical queue names are derived adapter
  configuration and are not work identity.
- **Enqueue granularity mirrors `processing_state` targets**: document-grain through E0;
  chunk-grain from E1 fan-out (chunking is the fan-out point); E3 adjudication consumes
  **batches per (document, entity)** — the observation-design batching rule (one block fetch,
  batched adjudication) applied as the enqueue unit, which also concentrates cross-cloud
  round-trips (§5).
- **Rate limits and concurrency are per-queue config**, sized against the two shared
  bottlenecks: Postgres write capacity through pgBouncer (the cross-cloud spine) and
  per-provider LLM rate limits. Queues meter *volume*; the cascades already meter *ambiguity*
  (D4) — the two knobs are deliberately different mechanisms.
- **K and P workers keep their own trigger models** (debounce window; schedule — D12) and do
  not use lanes; lanes are a plane-E concept. Their jobs still record `processing_state` rows
  (`build_snapshot`, `compile_knowledge`, …) like everything else, with `lane IS NULL` and
  normalized `not_before` when their debounce/schedule is in the future. A domain trigger ledger
  may also carry a debounce timestamp—for example `knowledge_refresh_queue.not_before` coalesces
  evidence-change signals—but that row is not task delivery state. When it materializes a K/P job,
  the unlaned `processing_state` row is the only authority consulted by the D61 queue port.

The route is not the idempotency key. `processing_state` remains unique on
`(deployment, target_kind, target_id, stage, component_version)`, so a backfill seeder cannot
duplicate work already discovered by steady ingestion. First insertion establishes the route. A
duplicate steady enqueue may promote a pending/failed backfill row, preserving the live freshness
guarantee; a backfill enqueue never demotes steady work. An explicit operator replay may move a
dead-letter row between lanes. Each change affects future delivery rather than rewriting
historical costs.

Promotion has a closed transition table. For `defer_reason='budget'`, change the lane to steady,
keep `status='pending'`, clear the backfill defer reason, set `not_before=now()`, and run the steady
budget pre-flight when claimed (which may park it against the steady window). For
`defer_reason='scheduled'`, change only the lane and preserve the caller's `not_before`. For a
failed row with `defer_reason='retry_backoff'`, change only the lane and preserve status, due time,
attempts, and failure. Immediate pending work keeps its existing due/past `not_before`. Every
promotion is announced on the steady route after commit.

## 3. Two lanes: steady-state and backfill

Backfill (initial corpus load; version-bump reprocessing) and live ingestion run the **same
pipeline, same workers, same idempotency keys** — but **separate lanes**, so a million-document
backfill can never starve a fresh document's freshness SLA ("plane E processes promptly per
document" — requirements). Rules:

- **A backfill is defined by a version filter, nothing else** (D12): "all documents where
  `converter_version < X`", "all chunks where `extractor_version < Y`". A deterministic
  **backfill seeder** job — the one worker this document adds to the inventory — enumerates
  the filter into the backfill lane in bounded batches. Resumability is free: re-seeding is a
  no-op for every already-succeeded `(target, stage, version)` row, so a crashed or paused
  backfill continues by re-running the seeder.
- **Lane budgets are separate** (§4): backfill spend is a knob turned deliberately, never a
  surprise on the steady-state budget. The two dominant backfill costs are metered per lane
  and known in advance: extraction-side LLM calls (volume-proportional — design-review F8) and
  cross-cloud write round-trips (§5).
- **Priority is structural, not scheduled**: the steady lane's rate limits are never reduced
  for a backfill; a backfill gets whatever headroom the shared bottlenecks have left. No
  priority scheduler exists or is needed.

## 4. Budget enforcement — park, never drop

"Budgets enforced, not advisory" (overall §8) gets concrete semantics here:

- **Declaration**: budgets are per `(deployment, stage, lane, window)` — e.g. "extract_claims
  / steady / $N per day" — in deployment config.
- **Enforcement is a deterministic pre-flight check in the worker**: read the deduplicated
  `cost_ledger` total for the row's authoritative lane and window (cached, refreshed on the
  order of minutes — enforcement is a dam, not a scalpel; minutes of lag are priced in). If the
  budget is exhausted, the worker
  **parks** by setting `status='pending'`, `defer_reason='budget'`, and `not_before` to the
  window roll, then re-announces the row and exits *without* starting the handler
  (`processing_state.attempts` and `last_error` are untouched).
- **Parking is not failure.** Nothing dead-letters because of budget; no work is lost or
  skipped; the chain resumes exactly where it stopped when the window rolls or the budget is
  raised. Parking between stages is safe **by construction** — stages are independent
  idempotent steps, so there is no half-open cross-stage state to corrupt.
- **Exhaustion alerts carry the tier breakdown** (`cost_ledger.tier` — which cascade rung
  spent the money): the operator must be able to tell "the corpus got bigger" from "a prompt
  regression made the frontier rung fire 10× more often" in the alert itself, not by
  archaeology.

Each logical model/provider call writes an attribution row identified by
`(processing_id, attempt, call_key)`. The handler assigns a deterministic stage-local call key—D31
uses separate `selection` and `decontextualize` keys—so multi-call attempts are fully counted and
an acknowledged-late retry of one call is an idempotent insert. A batched call (a D58
window) is billed as one row on the claiming processing row; a batch never crosses a document or a
lane by construction, so lane budgets and document-level accounting stay exact without cost
splitting. `cost_ledger.lane` is copied from
`processing_state.lane` when that call begins. The budget lookup is therefore a range sum on
`(deployment_id, stage, lane, occurred_at)`; K/P calls can be metered on their unlaned route with
`lane IS NULL`, but they do not silently join either plane-E lane. A delivery envelope or Cloud
Tasks header cannot choose the attribution.

## 5. The cross-cloud write path (design-review F9, made binding)

Postgres lives on Hetzner; workers on GCP — every spine round-trip pays cross-cloud latency,
multiplied by millions of documents during backfill. Rules:

- **Batch writes per worker invocation.** A worker commits its target's rows in as few
  transactions as its semantics allow — never row-at-a-time chatter. The E3
  per-(document, entity) batching exists for adjudication correctness and pays again here.
- **Front-load reads.** A worker fetches its inputs (context bundle, blocking candidates) in a
  bounded number of round-trips at start — never incrementally inside a loop.
- **pgBouncer is in the loop for every load test**: the D23 partition/index test and the F9
  write-path test run at backfill concurrency before any backfill sizing is trusted.
- **Colocation contingency — an ops item, documented here, not an architecture change**: if
  measured backfill duration or egress cost is unacceptable, the latency-sensitive workers
  (E3's chatty adjudication) move adjacent to the spine. Store roles (D1/D6) are untouched
  either way.

## 6. Dead-letter operations

The DLQ **is** `processing_state` rows with `status='dead_letter'` (D12 — no separate
infrastructure). The operational surface over it is thin and deterministic:

- **Inspect** — SQL views by (stage, error class, component version, age); the preserved
  enqueue `payload` makes every dead letter self-describing and manually replayable.
- **Replay** — reset the row to `pending`, clear its retry defer reason, choose `not_before`, raise
  `max_attempts` above the current `attempts` by the approved replay allowance, and re-announce
  its `processing_id`. Attempts never reset, so cost-ledger deduplication remains stable.
  Unconditionally safe: the idempotency key is unchanged, so a partially-succeeded earlier attempt
  no-ops. Bulk replay is the same operation scoped by version or error class; an explicit operator
  transition may reroute it through the backfill lane when large. `payload` remains handler input
  for inspection, never the source of route, schedule, or retry state.
- **Poison detection** — the same target dead-lettering across ≥2 component versions is
  flagged for a human: that is a content pathology (a document that breaks the converter), not
  a transient, and no amount of retrying fixes it.
- **DLQ depth per stage is a first-class alert metric.** "Failures never disappear"
  (requirements) is only true if something is watching the place they go.

A handler execution increments `attempts` exactly once when it begins. On retryable failure,
`attempts < max_attempts` produces `status='failed'`, `defer_reason='retry_backoff'`, and a
backoff-derived `not_before`; at the total-attempt limit the row becomes `dead_letter`.
Non-retryable errors may dead-letter earlier. Delivery retries that never claim the row consume no
application attempt, and budget parking can never take either failure transition.

## 7. Observability — queries over existing state, not new state

Everything below derives from tables that already exist (`processing_state`, `cost_ledger`,
`projection_snapshots`, `knowledge_compilations`); observability adds dashboards, never a
second bookkeeping system:

- per-stage throughput / latency / error rate / DLQ depth (`processing_state`);
- spend by stage × cascade tier × lane against budget (`cost_ledger`);
- the end-to-end trace of one document — its `processing_state` rows, ordered, *are* the
  trace;
- freshness SLAs: plane E p95 ingest→relations latency; plane P `built_from_watermark` lag vs
  cadence; plane K evidence-change→recompile lag vs the configured window (the k_layers eval
  metric).

## 8. Invariants (D52, D53)

- **Execution classes are bound** (D52): every worker is deterministic, programmatic-LLM, or
  agent-harness per the inventory's rule; **no harness on a per-document, per-claim, or query
  path** — harness seats live only on plane K and the review/audit surfaces.
- **Every LLM-calling worker carries an append-only transcript** (D52 — the D33 ledger
  discipline as a standing rule for new workers).
- **Checker seats run on a different model family than their producers** (D53): judges,
  reviewer agents, and the K reflection pass never share a family with what they check.
