# Retrieval Design — the Query Machine

How agents get answers out of the memory: the primitives, the recipes, the response contract,
the consumption surfaces (API / CLI / MCP / mounted filesystems), and the rules that keep a
multi-store system honest. Binding design for decisions **D48–D51**, building on D8 (vectors in
Lance), D9 (parallel channels + RRF, zero LLM on the query path), D10/D44 (as-of mechanics),
D16 (scope views), D41 (`claims_as_of` and its bar), D43 (observation retrieval), D22 (the
retrieval eval). Driven by the scenario battery `plan/analysis/retrieval_scenarios.md`
(S1–S63) — every design element below cites the scenarios that forced it. Numbers are starting
points to measure, not committed constants (CLAUDE.md).

> **Reading this cold (CLAUDE.md Rule 1).** The memory has three planes: **E** (evidence —
> immutable claims, adjudicated relations/observations, all anchored on canonical entities with
> bi-temporal validity), **K** (compiled + authored knowledge pages in git), and **P**
> (projections: P1 Lance search indexes, P2 LadybugDB graph snapshot, P3 corpus filesystem).
> Two **grains** matter everywhere here: the **evidence grain** (claims — *what sources
> asserted*, immutable, possibly stale or contradictory) and the **fact grain**
> (relations/observations — *what the system currently holds true*, with adjudicated validity
> windows). A third, the **compiled grain**, is K pages (LLM-written syntheses with recorded
> citations and freshness). "**Hydration**" = resolving the bare IDs that search/traversal
> return into full, provenance-bearing records from Postgres, the source of truth. The primary
> consumers are **agentic coding harnesses** (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) — callers that can
> read files, compose API calls, and reason; the design leans on that hard.
>
> Search vocabulary used throughout: **FTS/BM25** — classic keyword search (full-text search;
> BM25 is its standard relevance-scoring formula) — finds *exact words*, which vectors miss;
> **semantic search** — matching by embedding similarity — finds *meaning*, which keywords
> miss; **RRF** (reciprocal rank fusion) — merging several ranked lists by rewarding items
> that rank high on *any* list (score ≈ Σ 1/(k+rank)), the standard way to combine
> keyword+vector+structured channels without tuning score scales against each other;
> **cross-encoder** — a small neural model that re-scores a query/result *pair* jointly —
> more accurate than embedding distance, too slow for more than a final top-k re-sort (hence
> optional and flagged); **continuation** — an opaque cursor a caller passes back to fetch
> the next page of a truncated result; **MCP** — the Model Context Protocol, the standard by
> which agent harnesses discover and call external tools.

## 1. The central stance: the agent is the query planner

D9 forbids LLM calls on the query path — so the intelligence must live in the **caller**, and
the callers are agents. The consequence is a design that does not try to be smart; it tries to
be **composable, self-describing, and honest**:

- **Composable** — a small set of typed, orthogonal primitives (§3) that agents chain; recipes
  (§4) are frozen chains, not new capabilities.
- **Self-describing** — the system teaches its consumers: MCP tool descriptions render from
  the recipe registry; a shipped **consumption skill** (§8) teaches the memory model itself.
- **Honest** — every response carries a machine-readable account of its own limitations:
  grain, freshness, contradictions, truncation, and a typed taxonomy of "no" (§5, §6).

**Non-goal (stated, not deferred):** a natural-language→query planner on the query path. An
agent that wants NL planning does it in its own head — that is what it is. (An off-path
"query advisor" could be built *as a consumer* of this API; it is not part of the system.)

## 2. The correctness rule: projections propose, the spine disposes (D48)

Every fast entry channel is a projection with **lag**: Lance is written inline but rebuildable
(P1), the graph is an hours-old snapshot (P2, D7), K is debounced. The design resolves the
mixed-freshness problem (`questions.md` #23) with one invariant — **scoped precisely to the
query engine**:

> **Stale projections may nominate candidates; only Postgres confirms truth.** Every
> **query-engine result** (API / CLI / MCP) has passed through by-ID hydration against the
> live spine, where its validity windows, invalidation state, and contradiction membership are
> re-read.

**Where the invariant does NOT apply — and what covers those surfaces instead.** Two
consumption paths never pass through hydration, and the design says so rather than
overclaiming:

- **Mounted reads** (P3 / artifacts / raw / the K checkout, §7) are snapshot reads by
  construction — an agent `cat`-ing a file gets the file as of the snapshot/compile. The
  covering mechanisms: every mounted surface carries **visible freshness metadata** (P3
  snapshot version + per-page freshness/flags in `_index.md`; K page provenance footers; E0
  artifacts are immutable-per-`content_hash`, so staleness does not apply), and the
  consumption skill (§8) teaches the covering *motion*: mounts are for orientation and
  reading; **anything load-bearing at the fact grain is verified against the spine**
  (a `lookup`) before acting on it.
- **K prose is never "confirmed" by hydration even via the API** — a compiled page's cited
  IDs can be re-checked, which detects *staleness*, but detecting it cannot make a stale
  synthesis correct or excise the one superseded sentence. K answers are therefore always
  **compiled grain** (§6) with `compiled_at` + staleness + open-flag state — never presented
  as live-confirmed fact. Current-fact questions route through relations/observations;
  the K page is the orientation layer above them.

Consequences, spelled out (S42, S43):

- On the query engine, staleness can only cost **recall** (a fact too new to be indexed is
  not found), never **correctness** (a superseded fact can never be served as current —
  hydration would see its closed window). Recall lag is bounded by projection cadence and
  *reported* (§5 freshness stamps); correctness is live, always.
- The one caller-visible artifact is **nominate-then-drop**: a projection may nominate a
  candidate that hydration rejects (just invalidated). The envelope reports dropped-count so
  ranked results are honest about their denominator.
- **Compound results revalidate as units, not rows (S17, S21).** A graph *path* is only
  meaningful whole: if hydration invalidates one edge of a nominated path, the **path is
  dropped as a unit** (and counted in `dropped_by_hydration`) — never returned with a hole.
  The engine does not silently recompute an alternative live path (that would hide snapshot
  staleness); the honest answer is the drop plus the P2 snapshot timestamp, and the caller
  re-queries if freshness matters. The same unit rule applies to any future compound shape.
- Cross-cloud topology aligns with this rule for free: entry and expansion run on **local**
  replicas (Lance datasets + the P2 snapshot on the API node's disk); the single cross-cloud
  hop is the **batched by-ID hydration** to Hetzner Postgres — the same hop that enforces the
  invariant (overall_design §7).

## 3. Primitives — the typed, zero-LLM operations

Each primitive is grain-typed (§6), accepts the two temporal parameters (§below), and returns
the envelope (§5). None calls an LLM; none has side effects (S-battery invariant: **reads
never trigger anything** — all K/E triggering originates from writes).

| Primitive | Signature (essentials) | What it is | Scenarios |
|---|---|---|---|
| `resolve` | text, type?, context_entities? → ranked entity candidates | query-time entity resolution over the registry's **non-LLM tiers T0–T3** (T0 canonical-alias exact, T1 trigram, T2 phonetic, T3 embedding similarity — embedding a query string is not an LLM call and the semantic channel does it anyway; **no T4 adjudication on the hot path**, D17). Inflected names (S50) ride the stored canonical aliases + T1/T2. Ambiguity → ranked candidates, never a silent guess (S51). Returns **current** identities, following `merged_into` survivor chains with the redirect disclosed (S60); *pre-merge* identity reconstruction is the transcript-based `identity_as_of` recipe (S61), never automatic | S1, S50, S51, S60 |
| `lookup` | relations(s?, p?, o?) / observations(entity, property?) / claims(doc?, entity?) / entity(id) / document(id) | scalar reads on the spine and its indexes; observation property matching is semantic-over-statement (D43) | S1–S4, S26 |
| `search` | channel × target × query, filters, k — channels: semantic \| bm25 \| fts; targets: chunks \| claims \| relations \| observations \| k_pages \| **media_segments** (D65) | the entry channels (P1 Lance + PG FTS), scalar-filtered before vectors (D8). `media_segments` is the **cross-modal** target — a logical target over per-modality subindexes: one Lance row per standalone image / video keyframe-or-shot / bounded audio segment, embedded by CLIP-class models that map pixels (or audio) and *text queries* into a shared vector space — so "the photo with the small red connector" matches pixels the description never mentioned (access is not discovery: an agent can open any file it *found*, never one it didn't retrieve). Rows carry modality + embedding family/version + representation + immutable source locator, hydrate to representation passage + preview + raw deep link, and RRF-fuse with the text channels (rank fusion only — different embedding families are never compared by raw distance); embedders are port config (D63), capability advertised **per query→target modality pair** — **any unconfigured pair reports as a typed `boundary`** (§5), never a silent gap | S6, S46, S52, S62 |
| `graph` | neighborhood(entity, hops, predicates?) / path(a, b, max_hops) | P2 snapshot traversal; as-of via inline path predicates (D44) | S17–S22 |
| `fuse` | result_sets → RRF-merged set | reciprocal-rank fusion of parallel channels (D9), exposed as an operator so *agent-composed* channel sets fuse the same way recipes do | S46 |
| `rerank` | candidates × signal — graph_distance(focal), evidence_count, cross_encoder (flagged) | the D9 rerankers as explicit, inspectable stages | S46, S48 |
| `hydrate` | ids, depth: record \| evidence \| sources \| bytes, locator? | the §2 confirmation hop + progressive deepening: record → evidence rows + claims → documents → GCS handles. At `depth=bytes` an optional **source locator** (D65) scopes the fetch to a time interval / region, returning a seekable, codec-aware segment (§7 — unmounted parity for media) | S5, S59, all |
| `transcript` | relation \| observation \| entity \| k_page → its decision history | adjudications, resolution decisions, compile provenance — the audit trail as a first-class query ("why do we believe…") | S8, S32, S35 |
| `delta` | since T, scope?, kinds? → changed evidence / pages | the change feed as a query (new / capped / invalidated / recompiled) | S13, S14, S30 |
| `pages_about` | entity \| key → K pages (+ freshness/flags) | **the K routing index read backwards**: the rule-key inverted index built for write-side routing doubles as the reader's discovery index — which pages exist about X, mechanically | S31, S45 |
| `aggregate` | enumerated forms: count / group-by-predicate / group-by-object / timeline(entity) / delta-top-entities(since T) / typed-absence(type, predicate) | see §9 — enumerated, not general | S12, S26–S28, S30, S40 |
| `scan` | filter → stream | the batch surface (§9): full exports for compilers, auditors, external analytics — same zero-LLM reads, streaming contract, separate resource pool from interactive | S53 |

**Temporal parameters — composed, not special-cased (S15/S16).** Every primitive that touches
validity accepts `valid_at` (world time: "what held at T") and `believed_at` (system time:
"what did we believe at T"; caps `ingested_at`/`invalidated_at` across *all* channels at once —
S43). One composition rule makes multi-step temporal questions free: **every envelope exposes
its timestamps in parameter-ready form**, so "who worked at Acme when the contract was
signed?" is two ordinary calls — resolve the signing's event time from the first result, feed
it as `valid_at` to the second. No special machinery, and none should ever be added; if a
temporal question cannot be composed this way, that is a design finding, not a recipe request.

Two honest limits on `believed_at`, stated rather than discovered (S43, S61):

- **Per-channel transaction-time horizons.** Postgres holds full belief history. Under D69 the
  *hot* P2 relation view is unbounded by invalidation age: it keeps every relation whose
  survivor-redirected endpoints remain emitted active nodes, so P2 reports a `null` (unbounded)
  retention-age horizon. Endpoint retirement/forgetting remains a structural projection boundary,
  not an age horizon. P1 carries live-filtered copies and may have a real channel horizon. The
  envelope exposes each channel's **`believed_at` horizon**; whenever one is finite, a query before
  it gets a typed `boundary` naming the fallback rather than a silent truncation.
- **Identity is resolved in the current regime by default.** `resolve`/`hydrate` follow
  today's aliases and merge redirects even under a past `believed_at`; reconstructing the
  *identity boundary* as it stood at T (pre-merge, pre-un-merge) is the explicit
  `identity_as_of` recipe over `resolution_decisions`/`merge_events` (D21 transcripts). The
  envelope states which identity regime answered, so an audit-date query can never silently
  mix today's identities with yesterday's beliefs (S61).

## 4. Recipes — frozen plans as registry data (D50)

A **recipe** is a named, versioned composition of primitives with fixed fusion/rerank
settings: `relation_hybrid_rrf`, `relation_near_entity`, `claims_verbatim`, `claims_as_of`,
`entity_timeline`, `identity_as_of`, `explain`, `brief`, `changed_since`, `contradictions`,
`pages_about`. Recipes are **registry rows, not code** — the same move as predicates (D5),
ontology (D15), and K routing rules (D45). A recipe row carries, concretely: `name`,
`description`, typed `parameters`, the **primitive chain** (an ordered composition of §3
operations with fixed settings — channel sets, RRF constants, rerank weights), two declared
enums — **`output_grain`** (fact | evidence | compiled | composite) and **`answer_intent`**
(current_facts | assertion_history | orientation | audit | change_feed) — plus `version` and
MCP-rendering metadata. (Full DDL joins the control-plane tables in
`postgres_schema_design.md`; the fields above are the contract.) Three payoffs:

1. **The linter can enforce semantics — mechanically, on the enums.** The rule is a
   constraint, not a prose judgment: `answer_intent = current_facts` requires
   `output_grain = fact` and a chain built only over validity-filtered
   relation/observation primitives. `claims_as_of` declares `assertion_history` over
   `evidence`, so the D41 bar ("claims never answer *is it true now*") is violated only by a
   registration the constraint rejects. A *name/description* smell-check (a recipe named like
   a fact query but declared evidence-grain) is an advisory lint for humans, not the
   enforcement mechanism.
2. **The eval harness measures per recipe.** Recall@k per recipe per scenario class (D22's
   retrieval half); recipe versions make regressions attributable.
3. **MCP tools render from the registry** — the tool list *is* the recipe registry
   (name/description/parameters), exactly as extraction prompts render from the ontology
   registry. Adding a recipe = inserting a row; every surface updates.

Recipes never add capability — anything a recipe does, an agent can compose from §3. That is
a testable property (the eval harness replays each recipe as its primitive chain and diffs).

## 5. The response envelope — the contract is the answer's self-account (D49)

Most systems return rows. This one returns rows **plus machine-readable claims about the
answer itself** — because the caller is an agent that must *reason about* the answer:

```
{
  grain:        fact | evidence | compiled | composite,  // §6; composite ⇒ read parts[]
  parts: [ {                                            // one part per grain in a compound answer
    grain:      fact | evidence | compiled,            // each part single-grain (S47)
    results: [ { …record…,
        validity: {valid_from, valid_until, ingested_at, invalidated_at},
        evidence_count, confidence,
        contradiction: {group_id, co_members[≤cap], returned, total, continuation} | null,
        provenance: {hydrate_handle, depth_available,
                     // D65 — on EVIDENCE-GRAIN items only (a claim has one derivation;
                     // a fact aggregates many — its evidence hydrates to per-claim records):
                     source_locators[]?, derivation: {kind, evidence_mode}? } } ] } ],
  as_of:        {valid_at, believed_at,                 // the temporal params actually applied (echo)
                 identity_regime: current | as_of},     // S61 — which identity boundary answered
  freshness: {                                          // per contributing source (S42)
      pg: live_ts, p1: {max_write_lag, believed_at_horizon},
      p2: {snapshot_ts, believed_at_horizon},           // horizons: §3 — beyond them, `boundary`
      k:  {compiled_at, stale: bool, open_flags: n} },  // ← k_layers spike 9 lands here
  truncation:   {truncated: bool, returned, estimated_total, continuation} | null,  // S18/S49
  dropped_by_hydration: n,                             // §2 nominate-then-drop honesty (paths drop as units)
  negative:     null | {kind, explanation, workaround}  // §below
}
```

(Single-grain answers are the common case: one entry in `parts[]`, top-level
`grain` = that part's grain — flat to consume. `composite` appears only for compound recipes
like S47's said-vs-believe pair, and each part is still strictly single-grain, so the §6
discipline is never diluted.)

Three rules that are contract, not garnish:

- **Contradiction co-members are never silently absent (S23).** Returning one side of a live
  `contradiction_group` with no indication of the others is a **contract violation**, not a
  ranking choice — "contradictions are surfaced, never silently resolved" applied to the read
  path. The bounded form: co-members return **inline up to a guaranteed cap** (typical groups
  are 2–3 sides; both FY2023 revenue figures come back together, with per-side evidence
  handles); beyond the cap the contradiction block still *always* carries `group_id`,
  `returned`, `total`, and a `continuation` — bounded like every hub answer, one-sided never.
- **No silent caps (S18, S49).** Hub neighborhoods and big result sets return ranked pages
  with explicit truncation markers and continuations — never a silent top-k posing as
  everything, never a timeout.
- **The K freshness block is the reader-facing flag surface** (resolves `k_layers_design.md`
  §11 spike 9): any answer that consumed a K page carries its `compiled_at`, staleness, and
  open-flag count, and P3's generated `_index.md` shows the same per page — an agent can see
  "this to-be page has 3 unresolved evidence-change flags" *before* planning against it (S34).
  (The third candidate surface — a per-page status sidecar file — is dropped: two surfaces
  cover both consumption modes, and a sidecar would be a second mutable state to keep honest.)

Two media additions to the provenance block (D65, `media_design.md` §4–§5) — both attach at
the **evidence grain**: a *claim* has one derivation record and one locator set; a *fact*
aggregates many claims with possibly different modes, models, and locators, so a fact-grain
result never carries a single flattened `derivation` — its evidence hydrates to per-claim
provenance records, association intact:

- **Source locators** — for evidence derived from media (or paginated paper), the provenance
  block carries the typed locator(s): the exact page/bbox, image region, or time interval of
  the raw original the evidence traces to, rendered as deep links (`original.mp3#t=873` — a
  display rendering; mounted consumers seek locally with the structured locator, unmounted
  consumers pass it to `hydrate depth=bytes`; `media_design.md` §8). Locators are pinned to
  the document version + representation and precision-honest; the agent lands on the moment,
  not on a 90-minute file (S59, S63).
- **Derivation disclosure** — evidence extracted from a media representation carries its
  `derivation_kind` (asr | acoustic_events | vlm_description | ocr | shot_notes | …) and
  **`evidence_mode`**:
  `source_expression` (a fallible rendering of speech/symbols present in the source — a
  transcript sentence, OCR'd text), `model_observation` (the model's account of what the
  source *shows* — "the image shows a red valve"), or `model_interpretation` (the model's
  reading *into* the source — "the speaker sounds hesitant"). Inherited deterministically
  from the converter's mode-homogeneous labeled ranges (a claim spanning modes takes the
  most-mediated one), cached on the claim's occurrence record, never judged per claim at
  read time; disclosure, never a verdict. An agent reading "Alice looked hesitant" sees
  `model_interpretation (vlm)` and weighs it.

**The negative taxonomy — typed "no"s (S29, S39, S55).** Each demands a different agent
reaction, so they are distinct envelope kinds, fixed now (retrofitting a taxonomy onto a
deployed API breaks consumers):

| kind | meaning | agent's correct move |
|---|---|---|
| `unknown_entity` | nothing resolves | widen resolution, check spelling, try search |
| `known_empty` | entity exists; no matching facts | trust the absence (within freshness) |
| `boundary` | a stated capability limit (e.g. S29 cross-entity numeric range scans, the D43 price) | named limitation + workaround in the envelope; re-plan |
| (forgotten) | hard-deleted content — **indistinguishable from never-existed** (S55), so it is *not* a kind: it surfaces as `unknown_entity`/`known_empty` | — |

(There is deliberately no `denied` kind: content-level authorization is a library non-goal —
§9. If a future deployment-side layer adds one, its wire behavior must be
indistinguishable-from-empty, which is why the taxonomy is safe to freeze without it.)

## 6. The grain type-system (D49)

The fact/evidence split (`concepts.md`; requirements §Retrieval) becomes a **type
discipline** rather than documentation:

- Every primitive and recipe **declares its grain**; every envelope **carries it**.
- "Current-fact" answers may be assembled **only** from validity-filtered
  relations/observations. Claims answer *what sources asserted* — a claim's asserted-validity
  interval (D41) is testimony, never verdict, and the registry linter bars any composition
  that would let it pose as one (S4, S11).
- Mixed answers are **explicitly two-part**, never blended: S47 ("everything Alice *said*
  about pricing, plus what we *believe*") returns an evidence-grain timeline and a
  fact-grain snapshot as separate, labeled sections of one response.
- **Evidence-grain answers default to *current testimony*** (D54): claims superseded by a newer
  extraction generation, or left behind by a living document's current version, are excluded
  unless the caller opts in (`include_superseded_testimony`) — and the envelope disclosure says
  which regime answered. `claims_as_of` is historical by definition and runs over all
  testimony. Fact-grain answers carry a `support: current | withdrawn` marker where a fact's
  current-testimony support has dropped to zero (flagged, not vanished — D54).
- The compiled grain carries its own honesty device: the K freshness block (§5) — a compiled
  answer is *pre-paid synthesis with a timestamp*, and says so.

## 7. Surfaces — filesystem-first for harnesses (D51)

Four consumption surfaces, one precedence rule, full parity.

**The mounts (read-only, four):** P3 corpus filesystem (navigate first), E0 artifacts
(Markdown + structure + derived media), E0 raw originals (off the navigation path — explicit
pointers only; whole-file media for multimodal ingestion; audit-logged; storage class routed
by mime — `e0_files_design.md` §2/§5), and the K repo (a read-only checkout: compiled +
authored pages, `_index.md`/`llms.txt` orientation). Markdown is what navigation promotes;
originals are reachable deliberately (S56, S59).

**API / CLI / MCP:** the primitives and recipes of §3–§4. The MCP tool list renders from the
recipe registry (§4); CLI mirrors the API 1:1 (agents shell out); the API is the one place
authorization is enforced for query-engine reads (§9).

**The precedence rule (S56/S57).** Everything *readable* is available through both mounts and
API/CLI — some environments cannot mount, so parity is a hard requirement. When mounts are
available, agents are instructed (by the skill, §8) to **prefer the filesystem for everything
a filesystem can do** — navigate, read, grep — because harnesses are exceptionally good at
filesystem work, it costs the serving stack nothing, and it needs no network round-trips. The
API/CLI is reserved for what has **no filesystem equivalent**: semantic search, graph
traversal, temporal as-of, hydration, transcripts, deltas. When mounts are unavailable, the
API/CLI carries everything, including artifact/media byte fetches by handle (S57) — and for
time-coded media, a **locator-aware serving operation** (D65): `hydrate depth=bytes` accepts
a source locator and returns a seekable, codec-aware segment for the referenced interval or
region, so an unmounted agent inspects ten seconds of a 2 GB recording without downloading it
(S59 parity; a naive byte-range is a false promise for arbitrary video codecs). Clip
extraction is a serving operation, never a new stored artifact.

**Progressive disclosure as a query strategy.** The skill teaches one default motion: **orient
on K** (cheap, pre-paid synthesis — `brief`, `pages_about`, or just reading the mounted repo)
→ **verify on the spine** (fact-grain lookups for anything load-bearing, which also
refreshes past K's compile timestamp) → **audit on evidence** (hydrate to claims/sources when
stakes demand). Three coordinated maps of one territory: `llms.txt` (orientation), P3 (the
corpus as files), `pages_about` (the routing index read backwards).

## 8. The consumption skill — a shipped, versioned deliverable (D51)

The system ships **agent-facing instructions** that teach a cold harness the memory. The
curriculum, explicitly:

- **The planes, and the terminology ladder** (claim → relation/observation → *fact* → core
  belief — `concepts.md` §0).
- **The first rule of asking: questions about what is true go to the fact layer.** Relations
  and observations are the system's current, adjudicated holdings — validity-filtered,
  supersession-honoring. Claims are *testimony*: records of what sources said, possibly
  stale, superseded, or contradicted; they answer "who said what, when" and never "is it true
  now" (the D41 bar — enforced by the recipe registry, but the skill states it as the
  agent's default, not just a guardrail it will bounce off).
- **Testimony currency** (D54): even within the evidence grain, default claim search returns
  *current* testimony only — claims superseded by a newer extraction generation or left
  behind by a living document's current version are history, reachable via the explicit
  `include_superseded_testimony` opt-in or `claims_as_of`; the envelope always says which
  regime answered.
- **The `support: withdrawn` marker**: a fact carrying it has lost all current support (its
  case is in review) — read it as "standing but shaky": fine to report with the caveat, not
  fine to build plans on without checking the transcript.
- **Media: the three kinds of time, named apart** (D65). `start_ms` in a source locator is
  *where in the file* the evidence occurs (minute 14 of the recording); `valid_from`/D41
  asserted validity is *when the fact held in the world*; `ingested_at`/`believed_at` is
  *when the system learned it*. They are different axes — a claim spoken at minute 14 of a
  2023 recording about a 2019 event has all three, all different — and calling any two of
  them "the timestamp" produces wrong as-of queries.
- **Media: derivation disclosure and the drop to raw** (D65). Evidence from media carries its
  `evidence_mode` — `source_expression` (rendered speech/text: a transcript sentence),
  `model_observation` (what the model saw: "the image shows a red valve"),
  `model_interpretation` (what the model read into it: "the speaker sounds hesitant") — read
  it before weighing the fact. Every media-derived answer carries source locators as deep
  links; when the derivation isn't enough (tone matters, the detail is visual), follow the
  locator to the raw original — mounted (off-path, via the explicit pointer) or served by
  interval — and look/listen yourself. The transcript is the map, not the territory.
- **Validity and the two time axes; contradiction semantics** (expect co-members; never pick
  silently); **the envelope and the negative taxonomy**; **the mount layout and the
  precedence rule**; **the orient→verify→audit motion** (orient on K pages, verify
  load-bearing facts on the spine, audit down to claims and sources when stakes demand). It is **versioned with the system and partially rendered per deployment** (scopes,
mounts, and enabled recipes differ) — the same registry-renders-the-prompt move as D15, aimed
at consumers instead of extractors. Its acceptance test is scenario **S58**: a harness that
has never seen the system, given only the skill, must orient via K, keep grains straight, and
respect the boundaries. The skill is not documentation *about* the system; it is part *of*
the system, and the eval harness runs S58 against every skill revision.

## 9. The trust model, aggregation, and the batch surface

**Trust model — content-level authorization is a library non-goal (S54).** The library serves
**one trust domain per deployment**: every agent that can reach a deployment's API or mounts
is trusted with everything in that deployment. This is not a gap but the deployment model's
own logic (registries §1) carried to its conclusion — deployments are already fully
independent instances precisely so that data with different trust boundaries never co-resolves.
The rules:

- **Isolation is achieved by deployment separation**, never by content filtering inside one
  deployment: data that must not be visible to a deployment's agents belongs in a *different
  deployment* (own Postgres, registries, projections, buckets, K repo).
- **Perimeter security is deployment infrastructure**, outside the library: who can reach the
  API/CLI/mounts at all is IAM / network / key management (`questions.md` #8, ops slice); the
  raw-mount audit logging (D51) stands, as an audit — not authorization — mechanism.
- **Why not in-library authz:** scope-level filtering would have to hold consistently across
  *every* channel (Lance, graph, PG FTS, K pages, P3, raw) — mounts cannot query-time-filter,
  so it degenerates to per-scope filtered projections of everything, i.e. a deployment inside
  a deployment. The deployment boundary *is* that mechanism, already designed. (D16's
  filtered-snapshot arm remains available as a *scope-view/performance* tool; it is no longer
  carried as an access-control mechanism.)
- S54 accordingly moves from "must be enforced" to a **documented boundary**: the scenario's
  correct outcome is "the deployment's perimeter admitted this agent; everything inside is
  answerable."

**Aggregation (S26–S30, S40).** Enumerated forms only — counts, group-by-predicate/object,
entity timelines, **delta-top-entities** (evidence gained since T, grouped by entity — S30,
bounded by the delta feed), and **typed-absence** (entities of type X with no relation of
predicate P — S40, an anti-join over the typed entity enumeration, answerable *because* the
ontology types entities) — each a bounded SQL shape with a predictable cost envelope. General ad-hoc
aggregation is **not** an interactive capability (an unbounded GROUP BY over 10⁸ rows is a
denial-of-service against the spine); the escape hatch is the batch surface. Cross-entity
numeric range scans over observation *values* remain a stated `boundary` (S29) — the D43
price, revisited only if a structured value column is ever added.

**The batch surface (S53).** `scan` streams filtered exports (relations of a scope, claims of
a doc-set, the delta feed) under a separate resource pool and no interactive latency promise.
Consumers: K writers, external analytics, auditors, migration tooling. Zero LLM, same grain
labels, same trust model (§9).

## 10. Performance envelope and topology

- **Interactive budget (starting point):** P95 ≤ ~300 ms for entry+expand+hydrate recipes at
  the 1M-doc target (the Zep/Graphiti reference point D9 cites), measured per recipe in the
  eval harness. Batch: throughput-bound, no latency promise.
- **Locality:** API nodes hold the Lance datasets and the current P2 snapshot on local disk
  (hot-swapped per D7); Postgres is the only cross-cloud hop (batched by-ID hydration +
  FTS/registry lookups). LadybugDB is embedded in-process (D13) — no graph server.
- **Hot spots named:** hub-entity neighborhoods (ranked pagination, §5 truncation); Lance
  scalar-filtered vector search at 10⁷–10⁸ rows (spike); multi-hop as-of path predicates
  (D44's known perf spike); `resolve` under trigram/phonetic load (registry indexes, D23).
- **Scaling shape:** query nodes are stateless-plus-replicas → horizontal; the spine scales
  reads via the by-ID discipline (no fuzzy scans on the hot path — D23's index philosophy).

## 11. Evaluation — the battery is the harness

The scenario battery (S1–S63) is the retrieval golden set's skeleton (D22): each scenario
class becomes labeled query/expected-result pairs; the harness measures recall@k and
precision per **recipe × scenario class × corpus slice**, plus contract tests that are
non-negotiable CI: grain labels present and truthful; contradiction co-members always
returned (S23); truncation always marked (S18/S49);
forgotten ≡ never-existed (S55 — the *contract*; its CI gate activates only when the
end-to-end deletion cascade, `questions.md` #24, is designed — retrieval CI cannot enforce an
unresolved lifecycle); recipe-vs-primitive-chain equivalence (§4); and S58 as the
skill's acceptance test. Rerank weights (graph distance, evidence count) are tuned on the
harness, never in production.

## 12. Non-goals (scope boundaries, not deferrals)

- **No LLM calls on the query path** (D9) — including no NL→plan compiler (§1).
- **No prose generation at query time** — answers are structured envelopes; synthesis is
  either the K plane's compile-time work (S31–S33) or the calling agent's job.
- **No corpus-wide ad-hoc synthesis as a query** ("what's interesting in the corpus?") — that
  is K's compile-time job; the query surface serves what K precomputed.
- **No cross-entity numeric range scans over observation values** (S29) — the documented D43
  boundary, surfaced as a typed `boundary` negative.
- **No query-time writes or triggers** — reads are side-effect-free; all K/E triggering
  originates from writes (`k_layers_design.md` §5).

## 13. Open spikes (measure before locking)

1. **Lance filtered hybrid search at scale** — scalar-prefilter + vector performance on
   10⁷–10⁸ relation/claim rows; index params per table.
2. **Hub pagination limits** — page sizes and continuation-token mechanics against S49-class
   entities (10⁴–10⁵ edges).
3. **Rerank weights** — RRF constants, graph-distance and evidence-count weightings per
   recipe, on the golden set (O6/D22).
4. **Multi-hop as-of path-filter performance** — shared with D44's spike list; decides whether
   heavy repeat as-of analytics get a materialized persistent as-of graph.
5. **Envelope overhead** — measure the envelope's size/latency cost on hub answers, and pick
   the guaranteed co-member inline cap value (§5 fixes the *shape* — inline-to-cap +
   group_id/counts/continuation beyond it; the spike only sets the number).
6. **Skill authoring + S58 protocol** — build the cold-agent test as a repeatable eval;
   iterate the skill against real harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode).
7. **Cross-cloud hydration batching** — batch sizes/latency for the by-ID hop under
   interactive load (relates to review F9's write-path twin).
8. **`resolve` context ranking** — how much caller-provided focal-entity context improves
   S51-class disambiguation, before considering anything heavier.
